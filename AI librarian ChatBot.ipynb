If you know some other pro-\\ngramming language, this appendix will help you to learn Java by reviewing the essential elements \\nof the language. Appendixes C, D, and E supplement the coverage of Java that is presented here by discussing methods, classes, inheritance, and file I/O.\\nIf you already know Java, note that this book uses applications, not applets. If you know only \\nabout applets, you should read at least the first few pages of this appendix.\\nintroduction\\n Applications and Applets\\n B.1 There are two kinds of Java programs, applications and applets. An application is simply a pro-gram that runs on your computer like any other program. It is a stand-alone program. In contrast, an applet is a program that cannot run without the support of a browser or a viewer. Typically, an \\napplet is sent to another location on the Internet and is run there. The term “applet” is meant to suggest a little application.\\nApplets and applications are almost identical. Once you know how to design and write one, it \\nis easy to learn to write the other. This book uses applications rather than applets.\\n Objects and Classes\\n B.2 An object is a program construct that contains data and can perform certain actions. When a Java \\nprogram is run, the objects interact with one another to accomplish a particular task. The actions performed by objects are defined by methods in the program. When you ask an object to perform \\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

Notice that there are four \\ntypes for integers—namely byte , short , int, and long . The only difference among the various \\ninteger types is the range of integers they can store and the amount of computer memory they use. \\nIf you cannot decide which integer type to use, use the type int. It has a large enough range for \\nmost purposes and does not use as much memory as the type long .\\nJava has two types for floating-point numbers, float  and double . If you cannot decide \\n between the types float  and double , use double . It allows a wider range of values and is used as \\na default type for floating-point numbers.\\nYou use the primitive type char  for single characters, such as letters, digits, or punctuation. \\nFor example, the following declares the variable symbol  to be of type char , stores the character \\nfor uppercase A  in symbol , and then displays that value—the A —on the screen:\\nchar symbol;\\nsymbol = \\'A\\';System.out.println(symbol);\\nNotice that we enclose the character A  in single quotes. Again note that uppercase letters and low-\\nercase letters are different characters. For example, \\'a\\' and \\'A\\' represent two different characters.\\nFinally, the primitive type boolean  has two values, true and false. You can use a variable of \\ntype boolean  to store the answer to a true /false question such as “Is myTime  less than yourTime ?”\\n Constants\\n B.17  A variable can have its value changed; its value varies. A literal number like 2 cannot change. It is \\nalways 2. It is never 3. Values like 2 or 4.8 are called constants, or literals, because their values \\ndo not change.\\nYou write constants of integer types with an optional plus sign or minus sign, but without \\ncommas or decimal points. Floating-point constants have an optional plus sign or a minus sign and no commas. You can write a floating-point constant in one of two ways. One way looks like the everyday way of writing numbers. For example, \\n9.8, -3.14 , and 5.0 are floating-point con-\\nstants, because they contain a decimal point. The second way is to include a multiplier that is a power of 10. You use the letter \\ne to represent both the multiplication sign and the 10. For example, \\nthe number 8.65 × 108 appears in Java as 8.65e8  (or in the less convenient form 865000000.0 ). \\nThe two forms, 8.65e8  and 865000000.0 , are equivalent in a Java program. Similarly, the number \\n4.83 × 10-4, which is equal to 0.000483, can be written as 4.83e-4  in Java.\\nThe e stands for “exponent,” since it is followed by a number that is thought of as an exponent \\nof 10. The number before the e can be a number with or without a decimal point. The number after \\nthe e cannot contain a decimal point.\\nOther types of literal expressions are also called constants. You write constants of type char  \\nby placing the character within single quotes. For example, \\'Y\\' is a constant of type char . A string \\nconstant is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes, as in \"Java\" .\\n Assignment Statements\\n B.18  You can use an assignment statement to give a value to a variable. For example, if answer  is a \\nvariable of type int and we want to give it the value 42, we could use the following assignment \\nstatement:\\nanswer = 42;\\nAn assignment statement always consists of a single variable on the left-hand side of an equal sign and an expression on the right-hand side followed by a semicolon. The expression can be another variable, a constant, or a more complicated expression made up by combining operators, such as \\n+ and *, with variables and constants. The value of the expression is assigned to the variable on \\nthe left of the equal sign.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

This value can be changed, \\nso that at one time the variable contains, say, 6, and at another time after the program has run for a while, the variable contains a different value, such as 4.\\nYou use an identifier to name a variable. Besides following the rules and conventions for \\nidentifiers, you should choose variable names that suggest their use or the kind of data they will hold. For example, if a variable is used to count something, you might name the variable \\ncount . \\nIf the variable is used to hold the speed of an automobile, you might call the variable speed . You \\nshould almost never use single-letter variable names like x and y. Also by convention, variable \\nnames begin with a lowercase letter.\\n B.14  A variable’s data type—or simply type—determines what kind of value the variable can hold. If the type is \\nint, the variable can hold integers. If the type is double , the variable can hold numbers \\nwith a decimal point and a fractional part after the decimal point. If the type is char , the variable \\ncan hold any one character from the computer keyboard.\\nJava has two kinds of types, primitive types and reference types. A primitive type represents \\nsimple, indecomposable values, such as a single number or a single letter. The types int, double , \\nand char  are primitive types. A reference type represents a reference, or a memory address, \\ninstead of the actual item stored at that address. A class type—which is a type for objects of a class—is a reference type. For example, \\nString  is a class type. A variable of a reference type is \\ncalled a reference variable. A second kind of reference type is an array type. We will discuss \\narrays in Segment B.86.\\nNote:  Naming conventions help you to distinguish among identifiers when reading a program.  \\nBy convention, variables begin with a lowercase letter, as do the names of primitive types. The \\nnames of class types begin with an uppercase letter.\\n B.15  A variable declaration indicates the type of data the variable will hold. Different types of data \\nare stored in the computer’s memory in different ways. Variable declarations are necessary so \\nthat the value of a variable can be correctly stored in or retrieved from the computer’s memory. Even though the mechanisms for storing values in the variables of class types differ from the \\n mechanisms used for primitive types, you declare variables for class types and primitive types in the same way.\\nYou declare a variable by writing a type name followed by a list of variable names separated \\nby commas and ending with a semicolon. All the variables named in the list will have the type given at the start of the declaration. For example:\\nint numberOfBaskets, eggsPerBasket, totalEggs;\\nString myName;\\nThe first line declares that the three variables numberOfBaskets , eggsPerBasket , and totalEggs  \\nwill contain values of type int. The second line declares that myName  will store a String  object.\\nYou must declare a variable in a Java program before you use it. Normally, you declare a vari-\\nable either just before it is used or at the start of a method definition.\\n Primitive Types\\n B.16  A whole number without a decimal point, such as 0, 1, or −2, is called an integer. A number with \\na decimal point, such as 3.14159, −8.63, or 5.0, is called a floating-point \\tnumber. Notice that 5.0 \\nis a floating-point number, not an integer. If a number has a fractional part, even if the fractional \\npart is zero, it is a floating-point number.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

If you know only \\nabout applets, you should read at least the first few pages of this appendix.\\nintroduction\\n Applications and Applets\\n B.1 There are two kinds of Java programs, applications and applets. An application is simply a pro-gram that runs on your computer like any other program. It is a stand-alone program. In contrast, an applet is a program that cannot run without the support of a browser or a viewer. Typically, an \\napplet is sent to another location on the Internet and is run there. The term “applet” is meant to suggest a little application.\\nApplets and applications are almost identical. Once you know how to design and write one, it \\nis easy to learn to write the other. This book uses applications rather than applets.\\n Objects and Classes\\n B.2 An object is a program construct that contains data and can perform certain actions. When a Java \\nprogram is run, the objects interact with one another to accomplish a particular task. The actions performed by objects are defined by methods in the program.

For example, a final \\nsemicolon ends each Java statement. These rules form the grammar for the Java language, just as there are rules for the grammar of the English language. The grammar rules for a programming language (or any language) are called the syntax of the language. We now look at the elements of Java in more detail.\\nelements of Java\\nIn this section, we examine how to use Java to perform arithmetic computations.\\n\\t Identifiers\\n B.10  You use identifiers to name certain parts of a program. An identifier in Java consists entirely of letters, digits, the underscore character \\n_, and the dollar sign $. An identifier cannot start with a \\ndigit and must not contain a space or any other special character such as a period or an  asterisk. \\nThere is no official limit to the length of a name, though in practice, there is always a limit. Although Java allows identifiers to contain a dollar sign, it is reserved for special purposes, and so you should not use $ in a Java identifier.\\nJava is case sensitive. This means that it treats uppercase letters and lowercase letters as \\ndifferent characters. For example, \\nmystuff , myStuff , and MyStuff  are three different identifiers. \\nHaving these identifiers in the same program could be confusing to human readers, and therefore doing so is a poor programming practice. But the Java compiler would be happy with them.\\nJava uses a character set, called Unicode, that includes characters from languages other than \\nEnglish. Java allows you to use these extra characters in identifiers, but you are not likely to find them on most keyboards. Segment B.68 discusses Unicode further.\\n B.11  Although it is not required by the Java language, the common practice, and the one followed in this book, is to start the names of classes with uppercase letters and to start the names of objects, methods, and variables (which you are about to see) with lowercase letters. These names are usu -\\nally spelled using only letters and digits. We separate multiword names by using uppercase letters, since we cannot use spaces. For example, the following are all legal identifiers that follow this well-established convention:\\ninputStream   YourClass   CarWash   hotCar   theTimeOfDay\\nSome people use an underscore to separate the words in an identifier , but typically we will not.\\nThe following are all illegal identifiers in Java, and the compiler will complain if you use any \\nof them:\\n.MyClass   goTeam-   7eleven\\nThe first two contain an illegal character, either a dot or a dash. The last name is illegal because it starts with a digit.\\n Reserved Words\\n B.12  Some words, such as the word if, have a special predefined meaning in the Java language. You \\ncannot use these words, called reserved words or keywords, for anything other than their intended meaning. A full list of reserved words for Java is given on the inside cover of this book. Within a programming environment, the names of reserved words are often highlighted in some way. In this book, they will appear in boldface.\\nSome other words, such as \\nString , name classes that are supplied with Java. They have a \\npredefined meaning but are not reserved words. This means that you can change their meaning, but doing so could easily confuse you or somebody else reading your program.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

This value can be changed, \\nso that at one time the variable contains, say, 6, and at another time after the program has run for a while, the variable contains a different value, such as 4.\\nYou use an identifier to name a variable. Besides following the rules and conventions for \\nidentifiers, you should choose variable names that suggest their use or the kind of data they will hold. For example, if a variable is used to count something, you might name the variable \\ncount . \\nIf the variable is used to hold the speed of an automobile, you might call the variable speed . You \\nshould almost never use single-letter variable names like x and y. Also by convention, variable \\nnames begin with a lowercase letter.\\n B.14  A variable’s data type—or simply type—determines what kind of value the variable can hold. If the type is \\nint, the variable can hold integers. If the type is double , the variable can hold numbers \\nwith a decimal point and a fractional part after the decimal point. If the type is char , the variable \\ncan hold any one character from the computer keyboard.\\nJava has two kinds of types, primitive types and reference types. A primitive type represents \\nsimple, indecomposable values, such as a single number or a single letter. The types int, double , \\nand char  are primitive types. A reference type represents a reference, or a memory address, \\ninstead of the actual item stored at that address. A class type—which is a type for objects of a class—is a reference type. For example, \\nString  is a class type. A variable of a reference type is \\ncalled a reference variable. A second kind of reference type is an array type. We will discuss \\narrays in Segment B.86.\\nNote:  Naming conventions help you to distinguish among identifiers when reading a program.  \\nBy convention, variables begin with a lowercase letter, as do the names of primitive types. The \\nnames of class types begin with an uppercase letter.\\n B.15  A variable declaration indicates the type of data the variable will hold. Different types of data \\nare stored in the computer’s memory in different ways. Variable declarations are necessary so \\nthat the value of a variable can be correctly stored in or retrieved from the computer’s memory. Even though the mechanisms for storing values in the variables of class types differ from the \\n mechanisms used for primitive types, you declare variables for class types and primitive types in the same way.\\nYou declare a variable by writing a type name followed by a list of variable names separated \\nby commas and ending with a semicolon. All the variables named in the list will have the type given at the start of the declaration. For example:\\nint numberOfBaskets, eggsPerBasket, totalEggs;\\nString myName;\\nThe first line declares that the three variables numberOfBaskets , eggsPerBasket , and totalEggs  \\nwill contain values of type int. The second line declares that myName  will store a String  object.\\nYou must declare a variable in a Java program before you use it. Normally, you declare a vari-\\nable either just before it is used or at the start of a method definition.\\n Primitive Types\\n B.16  A whole number without a decimal point, such as 0, 1, or −2, is called an integer. A number with \\na decimal point, such as 3.14159, −8.63, or 5.0, is called a floating-point \\tnumber. Notice that 5.0 \\nis a floating-point number, not an integer. If a number has a fractional part, even if the fractional \\npart is zero, it is a floating-point number.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='elements of Java   B-7\\nAll the Java primitive types appear inside the cover of this book. Notice that there are four \\ntypes for integers—namely byte , short , int, and long . The only difference among the various \\ninteger types is the range of integers they can store and the amount of computer memory they use. \\nIf you cannot decide which integer type to use, use the type int. It has a large enough range for \\nmost purposes and does not use as much memory as the type long .\\nJava has two types for floating-point numbers, float  and double . If you cannot decide \\n between the types float  and double , use double . It allows a wider range of values and is used as \\na default type for floating-point numbers.\\nYou use the primitive type char  for single characters, such as letters, digits, or punctuation. \\nFor example, the following declares the variable symbol  to be of type char , stores the character \\nfor uppercase A  in symbol , and then displays that value—the A —on the screen:\\nchar symbol;\\nsymbol = \\'A\\';System.out.println(symbol);\\nNotice that we enclose the character A  in single quotes. Again note that uppercase letters and low-\\nercase letters are different characters. For example, \\'a\\' and \\'A\\' represent two different characters.\\nFinally, the primitive type boolean  has two values, true and false. You can use a variable of \\ntype boolean  to store the answer to a true /false question such as “Is myTime  less than yourTime ?”\\n Constants\\n B.17  A variable can have its value changed; its value varies. A literal number like 2 cannot change. It is \\nalways 2. It is never 3. Values like 2 or 4.8 are called constants, or literals, because their values \\ndo not change.\\nYou write constants of integer types with an optional plus sign or minus sign, but without \\ncommas or decimal points. Floating-point constants have an optional plus sign or a minus sign and no commas. You can write a floating-point constant in one of two ways. One way looks like the everyday way of writing numbers. For example, \\n9.8, -3.14 , and 5.0 are floating-point con-\\nstants, because they contain a decimal point. The second way is to include a multiplier that is a power of 10. You use the letter \\ne to represent both the multiplication sign and the 10. For example, \\nthe number 8.65 × 108 appears in Java as 8.65e8  (or in the less convenient form 865000000.0 ). \\nThe two forms, 8.65e8  and 865000000.0 , are equivalent in a Java program. Similarly, the number \\n4.83 × 10-4, which is equal to 0.000483, can be written as 4.83e-4  in Java.\\nThe e stands for “exponent,” since it is followed by a number that is thought of as an exponent \\nof 10. The number before the e can be a number with or without a decimal point. The number after \\nthe e cannot contain a decimal point.\\nOther types of literal expressions are also called constants. You write constants of type char  \\nby placing the character within single quotes. For example, \\'Y\\' is a constant of type char . A string \\nconstant is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes, as in \"Java\" .\\n Assignment Statements\\n B.18  You can use an assignment statement to give a value to a variable. For example, if answer  is a \\nvariable of type int and we want to give it the value 42, we could use the following assignment \\nstatement:\\nanswer = 42;\\nAn assignment statement always consists of a single variable on the left-hand side of an equal sign and an expression on the right-hand side followed by a semicolon. The expression can be another variable, a constant, or a more complicated expression made up by combining operators, such as \\n+ and *, with variables and constants. The value of the expression is assigned to the variable on \\nthe left of the equal sign.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content=\"B-8  Appendix B   Java Basics\\nFor example, the following are all examples of assignment statements:\\namount = 3.99;\\nfirstInitial = 'B';score = numberOfCards + handicap;\\nHere we assume that amount  is a variable of type double , firstInitial  is of type char , and the \\nrest of the variables are of type int. If the variable numberOfCards  has the value 7 and handicap  \\nhas the value 2, the value of the variable score  is 9.\\nThe equal sign, =, which is called the assignment operator, does not mean equality. You can \\nthink of the assignment operator as saying, “Make the value of the variable equal to what follows.” \\nFor example, in the statement\\neggsPerBasket = eggsPerBasket - 2;\\nthe variable eggsPerBasket  occurs on both sides of the assignment operator. This statement sub-\\ntracts 2 from the present value of eggsPerBasket  and assigns the new value to eggsPerBasket . In \\neffect, the statement decreases the value of eggsPerBasket  by 2.\\n B.19  A variable that has been declared but that has not yet been given a value by the program is \\n uninitialized. Such a variable might literally have no value, or it might have some default value. For example, an integer variable might have a default value of zero, and a reference variable might have a default value of \\nnull , which is a predefined constant in Java. However, your program will \\nbe clearer if you explicitly give the variable a value, even if you are simply reassigning it the default value. (The exact details on default values have been known to change and should not be counted on.)\\nOne easy way to ensure that you do not have an uninitialized variable is to initialize it within \\nthe declaration. Simply combine the declaration and an assignment statement, as in the following examples:\\nint count = 0;\\ndouble taxRate = 0.075;char grade = 'A';int balance = 1000, newBalance;\\nNote that a single declaration, such as the last statement, can initialize some variables and not others.\\nSometimes the compiler may complain that you have failed to initialize a variable. In most \\ncases, this is indeed true. Occasionally, the compiler is mistaken about this. However, the  compiler \\nwill not compile your program until you convince it that the variable in question is initialized. To \\nmake the compiler happy, initialize the variable when it is declared, even if the variable will be given a different value before you use it for anything. In such cases, you cannot argue with the compiler.\\nNote:  A reference variable that contains null  does not reference any object.\\nAssignment Compatibilities\\n B.20  You cannot put a square peg in a round hole, and similarly you cannot put a value of one type in a variable of another type. You cannot put an \\nint value like 42 in a variable of type char . You can-\\nnot put a double  value like 3.5 in a variable of type int. You cannot even put the double  value 3.0 \\nin a variable of type int. You cannot store a value of one type in a variable of another type unless \\nthe value is somehow converted to match the type of the variable.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='elements of Java   B-9\\nWhen dealing with numbers, however, this conversion will sometimes—but not always—be \\nperformed for you automatically. For example, you can always assign a value of an integer type to \\na variable of a floating-point type, such as when you write either\\ndouble interestRate = 7;\\nor\\nint wholeRate = 7;\\ndouble interestRate = wholeRate;\\nMore generally, you can assign a value of any type on the following list to a variable of any \\ntype that appears further down on the list:\\nbyte → short → int → long → float → double\\nFor example, you can assign a value of type long  to a variable whose type is either long , float , \\nor double . Notice that you can assign a value of any integer type to a variable of any floating-point \\ntype. This is not an arbitrary ordering of the types. As you move down the list from left to right, \\nthe types become more complex, or wider, either because they allow larger values or because they allow decimal points in the numbers. Thus, you can assign a value of one type to a variable of either the same type or a wider type.\\nIn addition, you can assign a value of type \\nchar  to a variable of type int or to any of the \\nnumeric types that follow int in the previous list of types. However, we do not advise doing so, \\nbecause the result could be confusing.1\\nIf you want to assign a value of type double  to a variable of type int, you must change the \\ntype of the value explicitly by using a type cast, as we explain next.\\n Type Casting\\n B.21  A type cast is the changing of the type of a value to some other type, such as changing the type \\nof 2.0 from double  to int. The previous segment described when a change in type is done for you \\nautomatically. In all other cases, if you want to assign a value of one type to a variable of another type, you must perform a type cast. For example, you cannot simply assign a value of type \\ndouble  \\nto a variable of type int, even if the value of type double  happens to have all zeros after the decimal \\npoint and so is conceptually a whole number. Thus, the second of the following statements is illegal:\\ndouble distance = 9.0;\\nint points = distance; // ILLEGAL\\nTo cast the type of distance  to int, you enclose int within parentheses and place it in front of \\ndistance . For example, we would replace the preceding illegal assignment with\\nint points = (int)distance; // Casting from double to int\\nNote that when you type-cast from any floating-point type to any integer type, the value is not \\nrounded. The part after the decimal point is simply discarded, or truncated. For example, if the \\nvariable distance  contains 25.86, (int)distance  has an int value of 25. A type cast does not \\nreally change the value of a variable; distance  is still 25.86, but points  is 25.\\nRecall that when you assign an integer value to a variable of a floating-point type, the type \\ncast is done automatically for you.\\n1. Readers who have used certain other languages, such as C or C++, may be surprised to learn that we cannot \\nassign a value of type char to a variable of type byte. This is because Java uses the Unicode character set rather than \\nthe ASCII character set, and so Java reserves two bytes of memory for each value of type char, but naturally reserves \\nonly one byte of memory for values of type byte. This is one of the few cases where we might notice that Java uses \\nthe Unicode character set. Indeed, if we convert from an int to a char or vice versa, we can expect to get the usual \\ncorrespondence of ASCII numbers and characters.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

Just as we write minus five as –5, we cast sum \\nto an integer by writing (int)sum .\\n Arithmetic Operators and Expressions\\n B.22  In Java, you perform arithmetic by using the arithmetic operators +, -, *, /, and %. You combine \\nvariables and constants with these operators and parentheses to form an arithmetic expression. \\nThe variables and constants in an expression are called operands. Spaces around the operators, operands, and parentheses within an expression are ignored.\\nA unary operator is one that has only one operand, like the operator \\n– in the assignment \\nstatement\\nbankBalance = -cost;\\nA binary operator has two operands, like the operators + and * in\\ntotal = cost + (tax * discount);\\nNote that the operators – and + can be used as both unary and binary operators.\\nThe meaning of an expression is basically what you expect it to be, but there are some subtle -\\nties about the type of the result and occasionally even about the value of the result. The type of the value produced when an expression is evaluated depends on the types of the values being combined. Consider an expression with only two operands, such as\\namount – adjustment\\nIf both amount  and adjustment  are of type int, the result of the subtraction has type int. If either \\namount  or adjustment , or both, is of type double , the result is of type double . If we replace the \\noperator – with any of the operators +, *, /, or %, the type of the result is determined in the same \\nway. However, the operator % is typically used with integers, as you will see soon.\\nLarger expressions using more than two operands are viewed as a series of steps, each of \\nwhich involves only two operands. For example, to evaluate the expression\\nbalance + (balance * rate)\\nwe evaluate balance * rate  and obtain a number, and then we add that number to balance . Thus, \\nif balance  is int and rate  is double , balance * rate  is double  and so is the entire expression.\\nNote:  If all the items in an arithmetic expression have the same type, the result has that type. \\nIf at least one of the items has a floating-point type, the result has a floating-point type.\\nKnowing whether the value produced has an integer type or a floating-point type is typically \\nall that you need. However, if you need to know the exact type of the value produced by an arith -\\nmetic expression, you can use the following rule:\\nNote:  The data type of an arithmetic expression’s value matches the most complex, or widest, \\ndata type among the operands in the expression. In other words, the data type matches the type \\nthat appears rightmost in the following list:\\nbyte → short → int → long → float → double\\nFor example, if sum is float  and more  is int, sum + more  is float .\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

When you combine two numbers with the division operator / \\nand at least one of the numbers has a floating-point type, the result has a floating-point type. For \\nexample, 9.0 / 2 has one operand of type double , namely 9.0. Hence, the result is the type double  \\nnumber 4.5. However, when both operands have an integer type, the result can be surprising. For example \\n9 / 2 has two operands of type int, and so it yields the result 4 of type int, not 4.5. The \\nfraction after the decimal point is simply lost. When you divide two integers, the result is truncated, not rounded. The part after the decimal point is discarded no matter how large it is. So, \\n11 / 3 is 3,  \\nnot 3.6666 . . . . If nothing but a zero is after the decimal point, that decimal point and zero are still lost. Even this seemingly trivial difference can be of some significance. For example, \\n8.0 / 2 has \\nthe value 4.0 of type double , which technically is only an approximate quantity. However, 8 / 2  \\nhas the int value 4, which is an exact quantity. The approximate nature of 4.0 can affect the accu-\\nracy of any further calculation that is performed with this result.\\nOften, the % operator has operands only of integer types. You use it to recover the equiva-\\nlent of the fraction after the decimal point. When you divide one integer by another, you get a result (which some call a quotient) and a remainder. For example, 14 divided by 4 yields 3 with a \\n remainder of 2 (or with 2 left over). The % operation gives the remainder—that is, the amount left \\nover after doing the division. So 14 / 4 is 3 and 14 % 4 is 2, because 14 divided by 4 is 3 with 2 left \\nover. The % operator is called the remainder operator.\\nThe % operator has more applications than you might at first suspect. It allows your program \\nto count by 2s, 3s, or any other number. For example, if you want to do something to every other integer, you need to know whether the integer is even or odd. An integer \\nn is even if n % 2 is zero, \\nand it is odd if n % 2 is not zero. Similarly, if you want your program to do something to every third \\ninteger, you test whether the integer n is divisible by 3. It will be if n % 3 is zero.\\nProgramming Tip:  To make your arithmetic expressions more readable, place a space on \\nboth sides of each binary operator.\\n Parentheses and Precedence Rules\\n B.24  You can use parentheses to group portions of an arithmetic expression in the same way that you use parentheses in algebra and arithmetic. With the aid of parentheses, you can indicate which operations are performed first, second, and so forth. For example, consider the following two expressions that differ only in the positioning of their parentheses:\\n(cost + tax) * discount\\ncost + (tax * discount)\\nTo evaluate the first expression, the application first adds cost  and tax and then multiplies the \\nresult by discount . To evaluate the second expression, it multiplies tax by discount  and then \\nadds the result to cost . If you use some numbers for the values of the variables and carry out the \\ntwo evaluations, you will see that they produce different results.\\nIf you omit parentheses, as in the assignment statement\\ntotal = cost + tax * discount;\\nmultiplication occurs before addition. Thus, the previous statement is equivalent to\\ntotal = cost + (tax * discount);\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='B-12  Appendix B   Java Basics\\nMore generally, when the order of operations is not determined by parentheses, the operations \\n occur in an order determined by the following precedence rule:\\nNote:  Precedence of arithmetic operators\\nArithmetic operators in an expression execute in the order of their precedence, as follows:\\n ● The unary operators +, –\\n ● The binary operators *, /, %\\n ● The binary operators +, –\\nParentheses can override this order.\\nOperators that are listed higher on the list are said to have higher precedence. For example, \\nunary operators have a higher precedence than binary operators, and binary operators have a \\nlower precedence than unary operators. Operators of higher precedence execute before operators of lower precedence, unless parentheses override this order. Operators at the same level have the same precedence. When two operators have equal precedence, the operations are performed using the following convention:\\nNote:  Binary operators of equal precedence in an expression are performed in left-to-right order.\\n Increment and Decrement Operators\\n B.25  The increment and decrement operators increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1. The increment operator is written as two plus signs, \\n++. For example, the following Java statement \\nwill increase the value of the variable count  by 1:\\ncount++;\\nIf the variable count  has the value 5 before this statement is executed, it will have the value 6 after \\nthe statement is executed. Thus, this statement is equivalent to\\ncount = count + 1;\\nYou can use the increment operator with variables of any numeric type, but it is used most often with variables of an integer type such as \\nint.\\nThe decrement operator is similar, except that it subtracts 1 rather than adds 1 to the value of \\nthe variable. The decrement operator is written as two minus signs, ––. For example, the following \\nwill decrease the value of the variable count  by 1:\\ncount--;\\nIf the variable count  has the value 5 before this statement is executed, it will have the value 4 after \\nthe statement is executed. This statement is equivalent to\\ncount = count - 1;\\n B.26  You can use the increment and decrement operators within expressions, but when you do, the increment operator or the decrement operator changes the value of the variable it is applied to and returns a value. Although we do not recommend using the increment and decrement operators in expressions, you might see them used this way in code written by other developers.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content='elements of Java   B-13\\nIn expressions, you can place the ++ or –– either before or after a variable, but your choice \\naffects the result. For example, consider the code\\nint n = 3;\\nint m = 4;int result = n * (++m);\\nAfter this code executes, the value of n is unchanged at 3, the value of m is 5, and the value of result  \\nis 15. Thus, ++m changes the value of m and returns that changed value to the multiply operator.\\nIn the previous example, we placed the increment operator before the variable m. If we place \\nit after the variable m, something slightly different happens. Consider the code\\nint n = 3;int m = 4;int result = n * (m++);\\nNow, after the code executes, the value of n is 3 and the value of m is 5, just as in the previous \\nexample. However, the value of result  is 12, not 15, because m++ returns the value of m to the \\nmultiply operator and then changes the value of m.\\nThe two expressions n * (++m)  and n * (m++)  both increase the value of m by 1, but the first \\nexpression increases the value of m before it does the multiplication, whereas the second expres-\\nsion increases the value of m after it does the multiplication. Both ++m and m++ have the same \\n effect on the final value of m, but when we use them as part of an arithmetic expression, they give \\na different value to the expression.\\nSimilarly, both ––m and m–– have the same effect on the final value of m, but when we use them \\nas part of an arithmetic expression, they give a different value to the expression. If the –– is before  \\nthe m, the value of m is decreased before its value is used in the expression. If the –– is after the m, \\nthe value of m is decreased after its value is used in the expression.\\nThe increment and decrement operators can be applied only to variables. They cannot be \\n applied to constants or to entire, more complicated arithmetic expressions.\\nProgramming Tip:  To avoid errors and confusing code, use the operator ++ or –– only in a \\nstatement that involves one variable and no other operators.\\n Special Assignment Operators\\n B.27  You can combine the simple assignment operator ( =) with an arithmetic operator, such as +, to \\nproduce a kind of special-purpose assignment operator. For example, the following will increase \\nthe value of the variable amount  by 5:\\namount += 5;\\nThis is really just a shorthand for\\namount = amount + 5;\\nYou can do the same thing with any of the other arithmetic operators –, *, /, and %. For example, \\nthe statement\\namount *= 25\\nis equivalent to\\namount = amount * 25;\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

However, when you see 3.14159, you might not be sure that it is π and not some other number; somebody other than you might have no idea of where the number 3.14159 came from. To avoid such confusion, you should always give a name to constants, such as 3.14159, and use the name instead of writing out the number. For example, we might give the number 3.14159 the name \\nPI. Then the assignment statement\\narea = 3.14159 * radius * radius;\\ncould be written more clearly as\\narea = PI * radius * radius;\\nHow do you give a number, or other constant, a name like PI? You could use a variable named \\nPI and initialize it to the desired value 3.14159. But then you might inadvertently change the value \\nof this variable. However, Java provides a mechanism that allows you to define and initialize a variable and moreover fix the variable’s value so it cannot be changed. The syntax is\\npublic static final type name  = constant;\\nFor example, the statement\\npublic static final double PI = 3.14159;\\ngives the name PI to the constant 3.14159. The part\\ndouble PI = 3.14159;\\nsimply declares PI as a variable and initializes it to 3.14159. The word public  says that there \\nare no restrictions on where we can use the name PI. The word static  defines one copy of PI \\nthat every object of the class can access instead of having its own copy of PI. The word final  \\nmeans that the value 3.14159 is the final value assigned to PI or, to phrase it another way, it \\nmeans that the program cannot change the value of PI. Appendix C provides more details about \\nstatic  and final .\\nIt is a good practice to place named constants near the beginning of a class and outside of any \\nmethod definitions. That way, your named constants are handy in case you need to modify them. You might, for example, want to change the number of digits you provide for a constant.\\nNote:  The class Math  in the Java Class Library defines a static constant named PI just like \\nthe one we defined in this segment, but with more decimal places. The following segment \\ndescribes this class and shows how to access PI. You should use Math ’s PI instead of defining \\nyour own.\\nProgramming Tip:  Programmers typically use all uppercase letters when naming constants \\nto distinguish constants from ordinary variables. They use an underscore as a separator in multi -\\nword names. For example, FEET_PER_MILE  follows this convention.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

These methods are static methods. (Segment C.28 of Appendix C dis-\\ncusses static methods in more detail.) When you invoke a static method, you write the class name—\\nMath , in this case—a dot, the name of the method, and a pair of parentheses. Using the \\nname of a class to invoke a method is not typical. Ordinarily, you use the name of an object to invoke a method.\\nMost \\nMath  methods require that you specify items within the pair of parentheses. As we noted \\nearlier in this appendix, these items are called arguments to the method. Thus, a typical invocation of a method in this class has the form \\nMath. method_name (arguments ).\\nYou can invoke the method in an assignment statement, such as\\nvariable = Math. method_name (arguments );\\nor embed it within an arithmetic expression. That is, you can use Math. method_name (arguments ) \\nanyplace that you can use a variable of a primitive data type. Figure B-2 describes some of the available methods in this class.\\nThe class \\nMath  also has two predefined named constants. E is the base of the natural logarithm \\nsystem—often written e  in mathematical formulas—and is approximately 2.72. PI is used in cal-\\nculations involving circular geometric figures—often written π in mathematical formulas—and is approximately 3.14159. Because these constants are defined in the class \\nMath , you use them by \\nwriting Math.E  and Math.PI .\\nSimple input and Output Using the Keyboard and Screen\\nThe input and output of data is usually referred to as I /O. A Java program can perform I/O in \\nmany different ways. In this section, we present some ways to handle simple text input that we type at the keyboard and simple text output displayed on the screen.\\n Screen Output\\n B.30  Statements like\\nSystem.out.println(\"Enter a whole number from 1 to 99.\");\\nand\\nSystem.out.println(quarters + \" quarters\");\\nsend output to the display screen. As we mentioned earlier in this appendix, System.out  is an \\nobject within the class System , which is a class in the Java Class Library. This object has println  \\nas one of its methods. So the preceding output statements are calls to the method println  of \\nthe object System.out . You simply follow System.out.println  with a pair of parentheses that \\ncontain what you want to display. You end the statement with a semicolon.\\nWithin the parentheses can be strings of text in double quotes, like \"Enter a whole number \\nfrom 1 to 99.\" , variables like quarters , numbers like 5 or 7.3, and almost any other object \\nor value. To display more than one thing, simply place a + operator between them. For example,\\nSystem.out.println(\"Lucky number = \" + 13 +\\n                   \"Secret number = \" + number);\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

If we want a space between the 13 and the word “Secret” \\nin the preceding output—and we probably do—we should add a space to the beginning of the \\nstring \"Secret number = \"  so that it becomes \" Secret number = \" .\\nNotice that you use double quotes, not single quotes, and that the opening and closing quotes \\nare the same symbol.

You also should indent the second line to make the entire statement \\neasier to read.\\nLater, in the section about the class String , you will see that the + operator joins, or \\n concatenates, two strings. In the preceding System.out.println  statement, Java converts the \\nnumber 13 to the string \"13\" . Likewise, it converts the integer 7 in the variable number  to the \\nstring \"7\". Then the + operator joins the strings and the System.out.println  statement displays \\nthe result. You do need to be a bit careful, however.

If you want the output from two or more output \\nstatements to appear on a single line, use print  instead of println . For example,\\nSystem.out.print(\"One, two,\");System.out.print(\" buckle my shoe.\");System.out.println(\" Three, four,\");System.out.println(\"shut the door.\");\\nwill produce the following output:\\nOne, two, buckle my shoe.

Also notice that \\nthe new line starts after displaying the items specified in the println  statement. This is the only \\ndifference between print  and println .\\n Keyboard Input Using the Class Scanner\\n B.32  A Java program can read data from either the keyboard or another source such as a disk, and \\nplace it into memory. The Java Class Library provides the class Scanner  for this purpose. Here, \\nwe will use the methods in Scanner  to read data typed at the keyboard and place it into variables \\nthat we specify.\\nAs we noted earlier, the class Scanner  is in the package java.util . To use Scanner  in your \\nprogram, you must import it from this package by writing the following import  statement before \\nthe rest of your program:\\nimport java.util.Scanner;\\nBefore you can use any of the methods in Scanner , you must create a Scanner  object by writ-\\ning a statement such as\\nScanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);\\nThe variable keyboard —which could be any variable of your choosing—is assigned a Scanner  \\nobject that is associated with the input device that System.in  represents. This device by conven-\\ntion is the keyboard. The variable keyboard  has a class type.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

You can use any of these methods by \\n writing a statement that has the following form, where keyboard  is the Scanner  object that we \\ndefined previously:\\nvariable = keyboard. method_name ();\\nThe named method reads a value from the keyboard and returns it. That is, the expression \\nkeyboard. method_name () represents the value that was read. The previous statement then \\n assigns this value to the indicated variable.\\nYou can read integers and real numbers by using the following expressions:\\nkeyboard.nextInt() — Returns the next integer encountered in the input data.\\nkeyboard.nextDouble() — Returns the next real number encountered in the input data.\\nEach of these expressions ignores any white space that might precede or follow the number typed \\nat the keyboard. White-space characters are the characters that appear as spaces when printed on paper or displayed on the screen. The blank-space character is likely the only white-space charac -\\nter that will concern us at first, but the start of a new line and the tab symbol are also white-space characters.\\n B.34  Example. To read an integer from the keyboard, you can write a statement such as\\nsize = keyboard.nextInt();\\nwhere size  has been declared previously as an int variable. The user of your program would type \\nan integer and press the Enter, or Return, key. The value is read by the method nextInt , returned, \\nand assigned to the variable size .\\nTypically, you should display a message, or prompt, for the user to enter data. For example, \\nyour program might contain the following statements:\\nSystem.out.println(\"What is your age?\");\\nint age = keyboard.nextInt();\\nWhatever the user types appears in the same window as the prompt. Here, the prompt would  appear \\non one line and the user would type his or her age on the next.\\n B.35  Example. To read a real number from the keyboard, you can write statements such as\\nSystem.out.print(\"Enter the area of your room in square feet: \");double area = keyboard.nextDouble();\\nAfter the user types a real number at the keyboard and presses the Enter key, the value of the \\nnumber is assigned to the variable area . Since we have used print  instead of println , both the \\nprompt and the input data appear on the same line on the display.\\n B.36  Example. You can read more than one value per line of input. For example,\\nSystem.out.println(\"Please enter your height in feet and inches:\");\\nint feet = keyboard.nextInt();int inches = keyboard.nextInt();\\nThe user could type either\\n6 2\\non one line or\\n62\\non two lines. In either case, feet  is 6 and inches  is 2.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

The name of the input stream associated with the keyboard is \\nSystem.in . Likewise, an output stream is an object that directs data \\nfrom your program to an output device. System.out  is such an object, directing characters to \\na display.\\n B.37  More input methods. The class Scanner  includes the following method to read a string:\\nnextLine() — Returns the string that appears next in the input data.\\nFor example, if keyboard  is defined as shown earlier, the statement\\nString message = keyboard.nextLine();\\nreads the entire string that the user types before pressing the Enter key—including any spaces—\\nand assigns it to the variable message .\\nThe method next  in the class Scanner  reads the next group of contiguous characters that are \\nnot white space and returns it as a string. For example, you can use this method to read the next word that appears in the input data, as follows:\\nString word = keyboard.next();\\nWe used next  in Segment B.3 to read the user’s yes or no response.\\nThe Scanner  methods we’ve looked at— nextInt , nextDouble , nextLine , and next —often \\nare invoked in simple assignment statements, although that is not necessary. Since each method returns a value, you can call it within an arithmetic expression, for example.\\nThe if-else  Statement\\n B.38  In programs, as in everyday life, things can sometimes go in one of two different ways. If you have money in your checking account, some banks will pay you a little interest. On the other hand, if you have overdrawn your checking account, you will be charged a penalty. This might be reflected in the bank’s accounting program by the following Java statement, known as an \\nif-else  statement:\\nif (balance >= 0)\\n   balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;else   balance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;\\nThe two-symbol operator >= means “greater than or equal to” in Java. We use two symbols because \\nthe one-character symbol ≥  is not on the keyboard.\\nThe meaning of an if-else  statement is really just the meaning it would have if read as an \\nEnglish sentence. When your program executes an if-else  statement, it first checks the expres-\\nsion in parentheses after the if. This expression must evaluate to either true or false. If it is true, \\nthe statement after the if is executed. If the expression is false, the statement after the else  is \\nexecuted. In the preceding example, if balance  is positive or zero, the following action occurs:\\nbalance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

On the other hand, if the value \\nof balance  is negative, the following is executed instead:\\nbalance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;\\nThe indentation in the if-else  statement is conventional as an aid in reading the statement; it does \\nnot affect the statement’s meaning.\\n B.39  If you want to include more than one statement in either of the two portions of the if-else  state-\\nment, you simply enclose the statements in braces, as in the following example:\\nif (balance >= 0)\\n{   System.out.println(\"Good for you. You earned interest.\");   balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;}else{   System.out.println(\"You will be charged a penalty.\");   balance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;} // end if\\nWhen you enclose several statements within braces, you get one larger statement called a \\n compound statement. Compound statements are seldom used by themselves but often are used \\nas substatements of a larger statement such as an if-else  statement.\\nProgramming Tip:  Some programmers always use compound statements within other \\nstatements such as if-else , even when only a single statement appears between the braces. \\nDoing so makes it easier to add another statement to the compound statement, but more \\n importantly, it avoids the error that would occur if you forgot to add the braces. We encourage \\nyou to follow this convention, even though we do not always do so in this book to save space.\\n B.40  You can omit the else  part. If you do, nothing happens when the tested expression is false. For \\nexample, if your bank does not charge an overdraft penalty, the statement would be the following, \\ninstead of the previous one:\\nif (balance >= 0)\\n{   System.out.println(\"Good for you. You earned interest.\");   balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;} // end if\\nIf balance  is negative, the statement after the closing brace executes next.\\n Boolean Expressions\\n B.41  A boolean expression is an expression that is either true or false. The expression\\nbalance >= 0\\nthat we used in the previous if-else  statement is an example of a simple boolean expression. Such \\nexpressions compare two things, like numbers, variables, or other expressions. Figure B-3 shows \\nthe various Java comparison operators you can use to compare two expressions.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

Often, when you write an if-else  statement, you will want to use a boolean \\nexpression that is more complicated than a simple comparison. You can form more-complicated \\nboolean expressions from simpler ones by joining expressions with either the Java version of “and,” which is \\n&&, or the Java version of “or,” which is ||. For example, consider the following:\\nif ((pressure > min) && (pressure < max))\\n    System.out.println(\"Pressure is OK.\");\\nelse   \\n System.out.println(\"Warning: Pressure is out of range.\");\\nIf the value of pressure  is greater than min, and the value of pressure  is less than max, the output \\nwill be\\nPressure is OK.\\nOtherwise, the output is\\nWarning: Pressure is out of range.\\nNote that you cannot use a string of inequalities in Java, like the following:\\nmin < pressure < max  Illegal!\\nInstead, you must express each inequality separately and connect them with &&, as follows:\\n(pressure > min) && (pressure < max)\\nThe parentheses in the previous expression are not necessary, but we typically include them. The \\nparentheses that surround the entire expression in an if-else  statement are required, however.\\nThe binary operators && and || together with the unary operator ! are logical operators. We \\nlook at each of them next.\\n B.43  The operator &&. When you form a larger boolean expression by connecting two smaller expres-\\nsions with &&, the entire larger expression is true provided that both of the smaller expressions \\nare true. Thus, if at least one of pressure > min  and pressure < max  is false, the larger expres-\\nsion is false. Moreover, if the first part of the larger expression is false, the second part is ignored, since the larger expression must be false regardless of the value of the second part. For example, if \\npressure  is less than min, we know that\\n(pressure > min) && (pressure < max)\\nis false without looking at pressure < max ./H11350 Greater than or equal to /H11022/H11005 points /H11022/H11005 60\\n/H11349  Less than or equal to /H11021/H11005 expenses /H11021/H11005 income\\n/H11022 Greater than /H11022 expenses /H11022 income\\n/H11021  Less than /H11021 pressure /H11021 max\\n/H11005 Equal to  /H11005/H11005 balance /H11005/H11005 0\\n   answer /H11005/H11005 \\'y\\'\\n/HS11005 Not equal to !/H11005 income !/H11005 tax \\n   answer !/H11005 \\'y\\'Math\\nNotationName Java\\nOperatorJava ExamplesFiGUR e B-3  Java comparison operatorsThe if-else  Statement   B-21\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

You also can use || to form a larger boolean expression from smaller ones in \\nthe same way that you use &&, but with different results. The meaning is essentially the same as \\nthe English word “or.” For example, consider\\nif ((salary > expenses) || (salary + savings > expenses))\\n   System.out.println(\"Solvent\");else   System.out.println(\"Bankrupt\");\\nIf the value of salary  is greater than the value of expenses  or the value of salary + savings  is \\ngreater than the value of expenses —or both—the output will be\\nSolvent\\nOtherwise, the output will be\\nBankrupt\\nThe entire larger expression is true if either of the smaller expressions is true. Moreover, if \\nthe first part of the larger expression is true, the second part is ignored, since the larger expression \\nmust be true regardless of the value of the second part. For example, if salary  is greater than \\nexpenses , we know that\\n(salary > expenses) || (salary + savings > expenses)\\nis true without looking at salary + savings > expenses .\\nYou use parentheses in expressions containing the || operator in the same way that you use \\nthem with &&.\\nNote:  Short-circuit evaluation\\nWhen two boolean expressions are joined by either && or ||, the second expression is not evalu-\\nated if the value of the first expression implies the value of the entire expression. Such is the  \\ncase if the first expression is false when the operator is && or true when the operator is ||. This \\nbehavior is known as the short-circuit evaluation of a boolean expression.\\nBesides saving execution time, short-circuit evaluation can prevent execution errors. For \\nexample, the following statement prevents a division by zero:\\nif ((count != 0) && (sum / count > minimum))\\nIf count  is zero, the expression count != 0  is false. Thus, the expression sum / count > minimum  \\nis not evaluated, thereby avoiding the erroneous division.\\n B.45  The operator !. You can negate a boolean expression by preceding it with the operator !. For \\nexample, the expression\\n!(number >= min)\\nhas the same meaning as the expression\\nnumber < min\\nIn this case, you can and should avoid using !.\\nSometimes, however, the use of ! makes perfect sense. For example, if you have two strings \\nthat should be the same for normal processing to continue, you would compare them and issue a warning if they are not equal. Later, in the section about the class \\nString , you will see that you \\nuse the equals  method to compare two strings.

These smaller statements \\ncan be any sort of Java statements. In particular, you can use one if-else  statement within another \\nif-else  statement to get nested if-else  statements, as illustrated by the following:\\nif (balance >= 0)   if (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)      balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;   else      System.out.println(\"Cannot have a negative interest.\");else   balance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;\\nIf the value of balance  is greater than or equal to zero, the entire following if-else  statement is \\nexecuted:\\nif (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)   balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;else   System.out.println(\"Cannot have a negative interest.\");\\nWhen writing nested if-else  statements, you may sometimes become confused about which \\nif goes with which else . To eliminate this confusion, you can add braces as follows:\\nif (balance >= 0){   if (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)      balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;   else      System.out.println(\"Cannot have a negative interest.\");}else   balance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;\\nHere, the braces are an aid to clarity but are not, strictly speaking, needed. In other cases, they are \\nneeded. While you should use indentation to indicate your intentions, remember that it is ignored by the compiler.The if-else  Statement   B-23\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

The following two if-else  statements differ only in \\nthat one has a pair of braces, but they do not have the same meaning:\\n// First Version\\nif (balance >= 0){   if (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)      balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;}else   balance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;\\n// Second Version\\nif (balance >= 0)   if (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)      balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;else   balance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;\\nIn the second version, without braces, the else  is paired with the second if, not the first one, as \\nthe indentation leads us to believe. Thus, the meaning is\\n// Equivalent to Second Versionif (balance >= 0){   if (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)      balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;   else      balance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;}\\nTo clarify the difference a bit more, consider what happens when balance  is less than zero. \\nThe first version causes the following action:\\nbalance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;\\nHowever, the second version takes no action.\\nNote:  In an if-else  statement, each else  is paired with the nearest previous unmatched if.\\nProgramming Tip:  Indentation within an if-else  statement does not affect the action of \\nthe statement. For clarity, you should use indentation that matches the logic of the statement.\\n Multiway if-else  Statements\\n B.48  Since an if-else  statement has two outcomes, and each of these two outcomes can have an \\n if-else  statement with two outcomes, you can use nested if-else  statements to produce any \\nnumber of possible effects. Convention provides a standard way of doing this. Let’s start with an \\nexample.\\nSuppose balance  is a variable that holds your checking account balance and you want to \\nknow whether your balance is positive, negative (overdrawn), or zero. To avoid any questions \\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

To find out if your balance  is positive, negative, or zero, \\nyou could use the following nested if-else  statement:\\nif (balance > 0)\\n   System.out.println(\"Positive balance\");else if (balance < 0)   System.out.println(\"Negative balance\");else if (balance == 0)   System.out.println(\"Zero balance\");\\nThis is really an ordinary nested if-else  statement, but it is indented differently than before. The \\nindentation reflects the logic more clearly and is preferred. Although this is not a separate kind of \\nif-else  statement, we call this nested construction a multiway if-else  statement.\\nWhen a multiway if-else  statement is executed, the application tests the boolean expres-\\nsions one after the other, starting from the top. When it finds the first true boolean expression, \\nit executes the statement after the expression. The rest of the if-else  statement is ignored. For \\nexample, if balance  is greater than zero, the preceding statements will display\\nPositive balance\\nExactly one of the three possible messages will be displayed, depending on the value of the vari-able \\nbalance .\\n B.49  The previous example has three possibilities, but you can have any number of possibilities by add-ing more \\nelse-if  parts. In this example, the possibilities are mutually exclusive. That is, only \\none of the three possibilities can actually occur for any given value of balance . However, you can \\nuse any boolean expressions, even if they are not mutually exclusive. If more than one boolean expression is true, only the action associated with the first true boolean expression is executed. A multiway \\nif-else  statement never performs more than one action.\\nIf none of the boolean expressions is true, nothing happens. However, it is a good practice \\nto add an else  clause—without any if—at the end, to be executed in case none of the boolean \\nexpressions is true. In fact, we can rewrite our previous example in this way. We know that if \\nbalance  is neither positive nor negative, it must be zero. So we do not need the test\\nif (balance == 0)\\nThus, we can and should write the previous if-else  statement as\\nif (balance > 0)\\n   System.out.println(\"Positive balance\");else if (balance < 0)   System.out.println(\"Negative balance\");else   System.out.println(\"Zero balance\");\\n The Conditional Operator (Optional)\\n B.50  To allow compatibility with older programming styles, Java includes an operator that is a nota -\\ntional variant on certain forms of the if-else  statement. A conditional operator expression  \\nconsists of a boolean expression followed by a question mark and two expressions separated by a \\ncolon. For example, the expression on the right side of the assignment operator in the following statement is a conditional operator expression:\\nmax = (n1 > n2) ? n1 : n2;\\nThe ? and : together form a ternary operator that has three operands and is known as the \\n conditional operator. If the boolean expression is true, the value of the first of the two  expressions \\nis returned; otherwise, the value of the second of the two expression is returned. Thus, the logic of this example is equivalent toThe if-else  Statement   B-25\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

If you decide to use them in your program, realize that not everyone will \\nknow their meaning.\\nThe switch  Statement\\n B.51  Multiway if-else  statements can become unwieldy when you must choose from among many \\npossible courses of action. If the choice is based on the value of an integer or character expression, \\nthe switch  statement can make your code easier to read.\\nThe switch  statement begins with the word switch  followed by an expression in parentheses. \\nThis expression is called the controlling expression. Its value must be of type int, char , byte , \\nshort , or String . The switch  statement in the following example determines the price of a ticket \\naccording to the location of the seat in a theater. An integer code that indicates the seat location is the controlling expression:\\nint seatLocationCode;\\n< Code here assigns a value to  seatLocationCode  >\\n. . .\\ndouble price = −0.01;switch (seatLocationCode){\\n   case 1:\\n      System.out.println(\"Balcony.\");      price = 15.00;      break;   case 2:      System.out.println(\"Mezzanine.\");      price = 30.00;      break;   case 3:      System.out.println(\"Orchestra.\");      price = 40.00;      break;   default:      System.out.println(\"Unknown ticket code.\");      break;} // end switch\\nThe switch  statement contains a list of cases, each consisting of the reserved word case , a \\nconstant, a colon, and a list of statements that are the actions for the case. The constant after the \\nword case  is called a case label. When the switch  statement executes, the controlling expres-\\nsion—in this example, seatLocationCode —is evaluated. The list of alternative cases is searched \\nuntil a case label that matches the current value of the controlling expression is found. Then the action associated with that label is executed. You are not allowed to have duplicate case labels, as that would be ambiguous.\\nIf no match is found, the case labeled \\ndefault  is executed. The default  case is optional. \\nIf there is no default  case, and no match is found to any of the cases, no action takes place. \\n Although the default  case is optional, we encourage you to always use it. If you think your cases \\ncover all the possibilities without a default  case, you can insert an error message or an assertion \\nas the default  case. You never know when you might have missed some obscure case.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

If \\nyou omit the break  statement, the action just continues with the statements in the next case until \\nit reaches either a break  statement or the end of the switch  statement. Sometimes this feature is \\ndesirable, but sometimes omitting the break  statement causes unwanted results.\\nNote:  The controlling expression in a switch  statement provides an entry point to a case \\nwithin the statement. Execution continues from this point until it reaches either a break  state-\\nment or the end of the switch .\\n B.52  At times, you will want to take the same action in more than one case. You can list cases one after \\nthe other so that they all apply to the same action. In the following example, we have changed the seat location code to a character instead of an integer. A code of B  or b , for example, indicates a \\nbalcony seat:\\nchar seatLocationCode;\\n< Code here assigns a value to seatLocationCode  >\\n. . .\\ndouble price = −0.01;switch (seatLocationCode){\\n   case \\'B\\':\\n   case \\'b\\':      System.out.println(\"Balcony.\");      price = 15.00;      break;   case \\'M\\': case \\'m\\':      System.out.println(\"Mezzanine.\");      price = 30.00;      break;   case \\'O\\': case \\'o\\':      System.out.println(\"Orchestra.\");      price = 40.00;      break;   default:      System.out.println(\"Unknown ticket code.\");      break;} // end switch\\nThe first case, B, has no break  statement; in fact, the case has no action statements at all. Execu-\\ntion continues with the case for b , as desired. Note that we have written the cases in two ways to \\nshow two common programming styles.\\nThe controlling expression in a switch  statement need not be a single variable. It can be a more \\ncomplicated expression, but it must evaluate to a single value. The expression cannot indicate a \\nrange of values. That is, the expression cannot be a boolean expression like the ones you use in an \\nif-else  statement. Thus, if you want to take one action when the controlling expression has values \\nfrom 1 to 10 and a second action for values from 11 to 20, you would need a case label for each value. In situations like this, a \\nswitch  statement would be harder to write than an if-else  statement.\\nProgramming Tip:  Omitting a break  statement\\nIf you test a program that contains a switch  statement and it executes two cases when you \\nexpect it to execute only one case, you probably have forgotten to include a break  statement \\nwhere one is needed.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

You should also take care that the possible strings assigned to \\nseatLocationCode  match the case labels exactly. In this example, the labels use lowercase letters. \\nTo ensure that the value of the controlling expression uses lowercase letters, we can replace the \\nbeginning of the switch  statement with\\nswitch (seatLocationCode.toLowercase())\\nSegment B.76 later in this appendix will describe the String  method toLowercase  further.\\nenumerations\\n B.54  To compute a student’s quality-point average—also known as a grade-point average—a pro-gram could assign the number of quality points for a given letter grade to the \\ndouble  variable \\nqualityPoints . You could use a char  variable grade  for the letter grade, but then it could contain \\nany character, not just the letters A , B, C, D, and F . Instead, to restrict the contents of grade  to \\nthe values you specify, you could declare it as an enumerated data type, or enumeration. An enumeration itemizes the values that a variable can have.\\nFor example, the following statement defines \\nLetterGrade  as an enumeration:\\nenum LetterGrade {A, B, C, D, F}\\nLetterGrade  behaves as a class type, so we can declare grade  to have this type, as follows:\\nLetterGrade grade;\\nThe items listed between the braces in the definition of LetterGrade  are objects that grade  can \\nreference. These values behave as static constants. For example, you can write\\ngrade = LetterGrade.A;\\nto assign A to grade . You qualify each of them with the name of the enumeration just as you \\nqualify the constant PI with the name of its class Math . Assigning a value other than A, B, C, D, or \\nF to grade  will cause a syntax error.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

Therefore, you cannot define an enumeration within \\na method. Instead, define enumerations outside of any method definitions, preferably near the  \\nbeginning of your class. Also, note that no semicolon follows an enumeration’s definition. \\n Writing one, however, will not cause a syntax error; the semicolon will simply be ignored.\\n B.55  Example. You can use a switch  statement with a variable whose data type is an enumeration. For \\nexample, if we define LetterGrade  and grade  as in the previous segment, the following switch  \\nstatement assigns the correct number of quality points to the double  variable qualityPoints :\\nswitch (grade)\\n{   case A:      qualityPoints = 4.0;      break;   case B:      qualityPoints = 3.0;      break;   case C:      qualityPoints = 2.0;      break;   case D:      qualityPoints = 1.0;      break;   case F:      qualityPoints = 0.0;      break;   default:      qualityPoints = -9.0;} // end switch\\nSince the data type of the expression in the switch  statement is an enumeration, the case l  abels are \\nassumed to belong to that enumeration without qualification. In fact, writing\\ncase LetterGrade.A: // Syntax error\\nfor example, is a syntax error. However, if you need to reference one of the enumerated values \\nelsewhere within the switch  statement, you must qualify it.\\nSince we know that grade  cannot have values other than those in the enumeration, a default \\ncase is unnecessary. However, if you choose to omit the default case, you must assign a value to \\nqualityPoints  prior to the switch  statement to avoid a syntax error. Without this initialization, \\nthe compiler would think it possible for qualityPoints  to remain uninitialized after the switch  \\nstatement.\\n B.56  When the compiler encounters an enumeration, it creates a class that has several methods. Among them is the method \\nordinal , which you can use to access the ordinal value of an object within an \\nenumeration. These values begin at zero. Thus, in LetterGrade , the ordinal values of A and F are \\n0 and 4, respectively. For example, if you have the following assignment:\\nLetterGrade yourGrade = LetterGrade.A;\\nthe expression\\nyourGrade.ordinal()\\nreturns 0.

For example, the expression\\nLetterGrade.valueOf(\"A\")\\nreturns LetterGrade.A . The string passed to valueOf  must match the name of the constant exactly.\\nAppendix C discusses enumerations further, beginning at Segment C.30.\\nScope\\n B.57  The scope of a variable (or a named constant) is the portion of a program in which the variable \\nis available. That is, a variable does not exist outside of its scope. A variable’s scope begins at its \\ndeclaration and ends at the closing brace of the pair of braces that enclose the variable’s declara-tion.\\nFor example, consider the following statements that involve two variables, \\ncounter  and \\n greeting :\\n{\\n   // counter and greeting are not available here   . . .   int counter = 1;   // counter is available here   . . .   {      String greeting = \"Hello!\";      // Both greeting and counter are available here      . . .   } // end scope of greeting   . . .   // Only counter is available here   . . .} // end scope of counter\\nThe variable counter  is available anywhere after its declaration. The variable greeting  is avail-\\nable only within the inner pair of braces.\\nThe concept of scope applies to every pair of braces within a Java program, regardless of \\nwhether they delineate the definition of a class or a method, appear within an if-else  statement \\nor switch  statement, or appear within the loops described in the next section.\\nLoops\\n B.58  Programs often need to repeat some action. For example, a grading program would contain some \\ncode that assigns a letter grade to a student based on the student’s scores on assignments and exams. To assign grades to the entire class, the program would repeat this action for each student in the class. A portion of a program that repeats a statement or group of statements is called a loop. \\nThe statement (or group of statements) to be repeated in a loop is called the body of the loop. Each repetition of the loop body is called an iteration of the loop.\\nWhen you design a loop, you need to decide what action the body of the loop should take and \\nwhen the loop should stop repeating this action. Once you have made these choices, you can pick one of three Java statements to implement the loop: the \\nwhile  statement, the for statement, or the \\ndo-while  statement.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

A while  statement repeats its action again and again until a controlling boolean expression \\nbecomes false. That is, the loop is repeated while the controlling boolean expression is true. The \\ngeneral form of a while  statement is\\nwhile ( expression )\\n   statement ;\\nThe while  loop starts with the reserved word while  followed by a boolean expression in \\nparentheses. The loop body is a statement, typically a compound statement enclosed in braces \\n{}. The loop body is repeated while the boolean expression is true. The loop body normally \\ncontains some action that can change the value of the boolean expression from true to false and so end the loop.\\nFor example, the following \\nwhile  statement displays the integers from 1 to a given integer \\nnumber :\\nint number;\\n. . . // Assign a value to number hereint count = 1;while (count <= number){   System.out.println(count);   count++;} // end while\\nLet’s suppose that number  is 2. Since the variable count  begins at 1, the boolean expression  \\ncount <= number  is true at this point, and so the body of the loop executes. Thus, 1 is displayed and \\nthen count  becomes 2. The expression count  <= number  is still true, so the loop’s body executes a \\nsecond time, displaying 2 and incrementing count  to 3. Now count  <= number  is false, so the while  \\nloop ends. Execution continues with the statement, if any, that follows the loop.\\nNotice that if number  is zero or negative in the previous example, nothing is displayed. The \\nbody of the loop would not execute at all, since count , which is 1, would be greater than number .\\nProgramming Tip:  A while  loop can perform zero iterations\\nThe body of a while  loop can execute zero times. When a while  loop executes, its first action is \\nto check the value of the boolean expression. If the boolean expression is false, the loop body is not executed even one time. Perhaps the loop adds up the sum of all your expenses for the day. If you did not go shopping on a given day, you do not want the loop body to execute at all.\\n B.60  Infinite\\tloops. A common program bug is a loop that does not end but simply repeats its loop body \\nagain and again. A loop that iterates its body repeatedly without ever ending is called an infinite \\t\\nloop. Normally, a statement in the body of the loop will change some variables so that the control -\\nling boolean expression becomes false. If this variable does not change in the right way, you can \\nget an infinite loop.\\nFor instance, let’s consider a slight variation to the previous example of a while  loop. If we \\nforget to increment count , the boolean expression will never change and the loop will be infinite:\\nint count = 1;\\nwhile (count <= number){   System.out.println(count);} // end while\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

However, some infinite loops will run forever if left alone. To \\nend a program that is in an infinite loop, you should learn how to force a program to stop running. The way to do this depends on your particular operating system. For example, in a Unix operating system, you would press the key combination Control-C.\\nSometimes a programmer might intentionally write an infinite loop. For example, an ATM \\nmachine would typically be controlled by a program with an infinite loop that handles deposits and withdrawals indefinitely. However, at this point in your programming, an infinite loop is likely to be an error.\\n The for Statement\\n B.61  When a counter controls the number of iterations in a while  loop, you can replace the while  state-\\nment with a for statement, or for loop. The for statement has the following general form:\\nfor ( initialize; test; update)\\n   statement ;\\nHere initialize is an optional assignment of a value to a variable, test is a boolean expression, and \\nupdate is an optional assignment that can change the value of test.\\nFor example, the following for statement is exactly equivalent to the while  statement in \\n Segment B.59:\\nint count, number;\\n. . . // Assign a value to number herefor (count = 1; count <= number; count++)   System.out.println(count);\\nThe first of the three expressions in parentheses, count  = 1, initializes the counter before the \\nloop body is executed for the first time. The second expression, count  <= number , is a boolean \\nexpression that determines whether the loop should continue execution. This boolean expression \\nis tested immediately after the first expression executes and again after each execution of the third expression. The third expression, \\ncount++ , executes after each iteration of the loop body. Thus, \\nthe loop body is executed while count  <= number  is true.\\nIn the previous example, we declared count  before the for statement. After the loop  completes \\nits execution, count  is still available as a variable. We could instead declare count  within the for \\nstatement, as follows:\\nint number;\\n. . . // Assign a value to number herefor (int count = 1; count <= number; count++)   System.out.println(count);\\nIn this case, count  is defined only within the for loop and is not available after the loop completes \\nits execution.\\nProgramming Tip:  Although declaring a variable within a for statement is convenient, \\nrealize that the variable’s scope is then the for loop. The variable is not available after the loop \\ncompletes its execution.\\nThe counter in a for statement is not restricted to an integer type. It can have any primitive \\ntype. You can omit any of the expressions initialize, test, and update from a for statement, but you \\ncannot omit their semicolons. Sometimes it is more convenient to write the initialize part before \\nthe for statement or to place the update part within the body of the loop. This is especially true \\nwhen these parts are lengthy. Although you technically can omit the test from a for loop, you will \\nget an infinite loop if you do.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 32}, page_content='Loops   B-33\\nSome Java programmers tend to favor the for statement over the while  statement because \\nin the for statement the initialization, testing, and incrementing of the counter all appear at the \\nbeginning of the loop. This tendency is especially true for loops that simply count. For more \\n complex logic, a while  loop is often more appropriate.\\nNote:  A for statement is basically another notation for a kind of while  loop. Thus, like a \\nwhile  loop, a for statement might not execute its loop body at all.\\n B.62  The comma in for statements. A for loop can perform more than one initialization. To use a list \\nof initialization actions, separate the actions with commas, as in the following example:\\nint n, product;\\nfor (n = 1, product = 1; n <= 10; n++)   product = product * n;\\nThis for loop initializes n to 1 and product  to 1. Note that you use a comma, not a semicolon, to \\nseparate the initialization actions.\\nYou can have multiple update actions that are separated by commas. This can sometimes lead \\nto a situation in which the for statement has an empty body and still does something useful. For \\nexample, we can rewrite the previous for statement in the following equivalent way:\\nfor (n = 1, product = 1; n <= 10; product = product * n, n++);\\nIn effect, we have made the loop body part of the update action. Notice the semicolon at the end of \\nthe statement. Since a semicolon at the end of a for statement is often the result of a programming \\nerror, a clearer way to write this loop makes the empty body explicit:\\nfor (n = 1, product = 1; n <= 10; product = product * n, n++)\\n{} // end for\\nHowever, the most readable style uses the update action only for variables that control the loop, \\nas in the original version of this for loop.\\nFinally, you cannot have multiple boolean expressions to test for ending a for loop. However, \\nyou can string together multiple tests by using the && and || operators to form one larger boolean \\nexpression.\\nProgramming Tip:  If you have used other programming languages that have a \\n general-purpose comma operator, be warned that the comma operator in Java can appear  \\nonly in for statements.\\n B.63  Using an enumeration with a for statement. The for statement has another form when you \\nwant to repeat statements for each object in an enumeration. For example, if you define\\nenum Suit {CLUBS, DIAMONDS, HEARTS, SPADES}\\nthe for loop\\nfor (Suit nextSuit : Suit.values())   System.out.println(nextSuit);\\ndisplays\\nCLUBSDIAMONDSHEARTSSPADES\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

To the right of the colon, \\nyou represent the values that the variable will have. For the enumeration Suit , the expression \\nSuit.values()  represents the four possible values CLUBS , DIAMONDS , HEARTS , and SPADES . As \\nthe loop executes, nextSuit  takes on each of these values.\\nThis kind of loop—called a for-each loop—can be used with other collections of data, as you \\nwill see.\\n The do-while  Statement\\n B.64  The do-while  statement, or do-while  loop, is similar to the while  statement, but the body of a \\ndo-while  statement always executes at least once. As you saw earlier, the body of a while  loop \\nmight not execute at all.\\nThe general form of a do-while  statement is\\ndo\\n   statement ;\\nwhile ( expression );\\nThe do-while  loop starts with the reserved word do. The loop body is a statement, typically a \\ncompound statement enclosed in braces {}. The loop ends with the reserved word while  followed \\nby a boolean expression in parentheses and a semicolon.\\nProgramming Tip:  Be sure to include a semicolon at the end of a do-while  statement.\\nThe loop body executes and is repeated while the boolean expression is true. The loop body \\nnormally contains some action that can change the value of the boolean expression from true to \\nfalse and so end the loop. The boolean expression is tested at the end of the loop, not at its begin -\\nning, as it is in a while  statement. Thus, the loop body executes at least once even if the boolean \\nexpression starts out false.\\nThe following do-while  statement displays the integers from 1 to a given integer number :\\nint number;\\n. . . // Assign a value to number hereint count = 1;do{   System.out.println(count);   count++;} while (count <= number);\\nAgain, let’s suppose that number  is 2. The variable count  begins at 1 and is displayed. Next, \\ncount  is incremented to 2. Since the expression count  <= number  is true at this point, the body \\nof the loop executes again. The value of count  (2) is displayed, and then count  becomes 3. The \\nexpression count  <= number  is now false, so the do-while  loop ends. Execution continues with the \\nstatement that follows the loop.\\nIf number  is zero or negative in the previous example, 1 is displayed, since the body of the \\nloop executes at least once. If number  can possibly be zero or negative, we should use either a \\nwhile  loop or a for loop here instead of a do-while  loop.\\nNotice that we placed the ending brace and the while  on the same line. Some programmers \\nprefer to place them on different lines. Either form is fine, but be consistent.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 34}, page_content='Loops   B-35\\nTo better understand a do-while  loop, let’s rewrite the previous example in the following way:\\nint number;\\n. . . // Assign a value to number hereint count = 1;{   System.out.println(count);   count++;}while (count <= number){   System.out.println(count);   count++;}\\nWhen you compare the two versions, it is obvious that a do-while  loop differs from a while  loop \\nin only one detail. With a do-while  loop, the loop body is always executed at least once. With a \\nwhile  loop, the loop body might not execute at all.\\n Additional Loop Information\\n B.65  Choosing a loop statement. Suppose you decide that your program needs a loop. How do you \\ndecide whether to use a while  statement, a for statement, or a do-while  statement? You cannot use \\na  do-while  statement unless you are certain that the loop body should execute at least one time. If \\nyou are certain of this, a do-while  statement is likely to be a good choice. However, more often than \\nyou might think, a loop requires the possibility that the body will not execute at all. In those cases, you must use either a \\nwhile  statement or a for statement. If it is a computation that changes some \\nnumeric quantity by some equal amount on each iteration, consider a for statement. If the for state-\\nment does not work well, use a while  statement. The while  statement is always a safe choice, since \\nyou can use it for any sort of loop. But sometimes one of the other alternatives is easier or clearer.\\nProgramming Tip:  A while  loop can do anything that another loop can do.\\n B.66  The break  and continue  statements in loops. You can use the break  statement in a switch  state-\\nment or in any kind of loop statement. When the break  statement executes in a loop, the immediately \\nenclosing loop ends, and the remainder of the loop body is not executed. Execution continues with the statement after the loop.\\nAdding a \\nbreak  statement to a loop can make the loop more difficult to understand. Without \\na break  statement, a loop has a simple, easy-to-understand structure. There is a test for ending \\nthe loop at the top (or bottom) of the loop, and every iteration will go to the end of the loop body. When you add a \\nbreak  statement, the loop might end because either the condition given at the top \\n(or bottom) of the loop is false or the break  statement has executed. Some loop iterations may go \\nto the end of the loop body, but one loop iteration might end prematurely. Because of the compli-cations they introduce, you should avoid \\nbreak  statements in loops. Some authorities contend that \\na break  statement should never be used to end a loop, but virtually all programming authorities \\nagree that they should be used at most sparingly.\\nThe continue  statement ends the current iteration of a loop. The loop continues with the \\nnext iteration. Using a continue  statement in this way has the same problems as using a break  \\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

However, replacing an empty loop body with a continue  statement is acceptable. For \\nexample, you can revise the loop at the end of Segment B.62, as follows:\\nfor (n = 1, product = 1; n <= 10; product = product * n, n++)\\n   continue;\\nProgramming Tip:  In general, do not use break  or continue  statements within the body \\nof a loop.\\nThe Class String\\n B.67  Strings of characters, such as \"Enter the amount:\" , do not have a primitive type in Java. How-\\never, Java does provide a class, called String , that you use to create and process strings of char -\\nacters. The string constant \"Enter the amount:\" , in fact, is a value of type String . The class \\nString  is part of the package java.lang  in the Java Class Library.\\nA variable of type String  can name one of these string values. The statement\\nString greeting;\\ndeclares greeting  to be the name of a String  variable, and the following statement sets the value \\nof greeting  to the String  value \"Hello!\" :\\ngreeting = \"Hello!\";\\nThese two statements are often combined into one, as follows:\\nString greeting = \"Hello!\";\\nWe now can display greeting  on the screen by writing\\nSystem.out.println(greeting);\\nThe screen will show\\nHello!\\n Characters Within Strings\\n B.68  Most programming languages use the ASCII character set, which assigns a standard number to \\neach of the characters normally used on an English-language keyboard. Java, however, uses the Unicode character set instead. The Unicode character set includes all the ASCII characters plus many of the characters used in languages that have an alphabet different from English. As it turns out, this is not likely to be a big issue if you are using an English-language keyboard. Normally, you can just program as if Java were using the ASCII character set, since the codes for the ASCII characters are the same in Unicode. The advantage of the Unicode character set is that it allows you to easily handle languages other than English. The disadvantage of the Unicode character set is that it requires two bytes to store each character, whereas the ASCII character set requires one.\\n B.69  Escape characters. Suppose we want to display the following line on the screen:\\nThe word “Java” names a language and a drink!\\nThis string contains quotes, so the statement\\nSystem.out.println(\"The word \"Java\" names a language and a drink!\");\\nwill not work: It produces a compiler error message. The problem is that the compiler sees\\n\"The word \"\\nas a perfectly valid quoted string. Then the compiler sees\\nJava\"\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

The compiler does not know that we mean to include the \\nquote character as part of the string unless we tell it that we want to do so. We tell the compiler this by placing a backslash \\n\\\\ before the troublesome character, like so:\\nSystem.out.println(\"The word \\\\\"Java\\\\\" names a language and a drink!\");\\nSome other special characters also need a backslash in order to be included in strings. They \\nare listed in Figure B-4. These are often called escape characters because they escape from the usual meaning of a character in Java, such as the usual meaning of the double-quote character.\\nFiGUR e B-4 Escape characters\\n\\\\\" Double quote.\\n\\\\\\' Single quote (apostrophe).\\\\\\\\ Backslash.\\\\n New line . (Go to the beginning of the next line.)\\n\\\\r Carriage return. (Go to the beginning of the current line.)\\\\t Tab. (Insert whitespace up to the next tab stop.)\\nIt is important to note that each escape sequence is a single character, even though it is spelled \\nwith two symbols. So the string \"Say \\\\\"Hi\\\\\"!\"  contains 9 characters, not 11.\\nTo include a backslash in a string, you must write two backslashes. Displaying the string \\n\"abc\\\\\\\\def\"  on the screen would produce\\nabc\\\\def\\nWriting the string with only one backslash, as in \"abc\\\\def\" , is likely to produce the error \\nmessage “Invalid escape character,” because \\\\d is invalid.\\nThe escape sequence \\\\n indicates that the string starts a new line at the \\\\n. For example, the \\nstatement\\nSystem.out.println(\"The motto is\\\\nGo for it!\");\\nwill write the following to the screen\\nThe motto is\\nGo for it!\\nYou can include a single quote (apostrophe) inside a quoted string, such as \"How\\'s this?\" , \\nbut you cannot write a single quote within single quotes. Thus, to define a single-quote character, \\nyou use the escape sequence \\\\\\', as follows:\\nchar singleQuote = \\'\\\\\\'\\';\\n Concatenation of Strings\\n B.70  You can join two strings by using the + operator. Joining two strings together, end to end, to obtain \\na larger string is called concatenation. When + is used with strings, it is sometimes called the \\nconcatenation operator. For example, the statements\\nString greeting = \"Hello\";\\nString sentence = greeting + \"my friend.\";System.out.println(sentence);\\nset the variable sentence  to \"Hellomy friend.\"  and will write the following on the screen:\\nHellomy friend.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 37}, page_content='B-38  Appendix B   Java Basics\\nNo space separates the first two words, because no spaces are added when you concatenate two \\nstrings. If we want sentence  to contain \"Hello my friend.\" , we could change the assignment \\nstatement to\\nsentence = greeting + \" my friend.\";\\nNotice the space before the word “my.”\\nYou can concatenate any number of String  objects by using the + operator. You can even \\nconcatenate a String  object to any other type of object and get a String  object as a result. Java \\ncan express any object as a string when you concatenate it to a string. For primitives like numbers, Java does the obvious thing. For example,\\nString solution = \"The answer is \" + 42;\\nwill set the String  variable solution  to \"The answer is 42\" . This is so natural that it may \\nseem as though nothing special is happening, but it does require a real conversion from one type to another. The Java literal \\n42 is an integer, whereas \"42\"  is a string consisting of the two \\ncharacters 4 and 2. Java converts the integer constant 42 to the string constant \"42\"  and then \\nconcatenates the two strings \"The answer is \"  and \"42\"  to obtain the longer string \\n\"The  answer is 42\" .\\nNote:  Every class has a method toString  that Java uses to get a string representation of any \\nobject. If you do not define toString  for a class that you write, the default toString  will return \\na representation of an object’s location in memory. Thus, you generally should provide your \\nown toString  method when you define a class. Appendixes C and D discuss this method in \\nmore detail.\\nYou can also concatenate a single character to a string by using +. For example,\\nString label = \"mile\";String pluralLabel = label + \\'s\\';\\nsets pluralLabel  to the string \"miles\" .\\nSegment B.73 will show you another way to concatenate strings.\\n String  Methods\\nReaders who need to review Java methods should consult Appendix C before reading this section.\\n B.71  A String  object has methods as well as a value. You use these methods to manipulate string values. \\nA few of these String  methods are described here. You invoke, or call, a method for a String  object \\nby writing the object name, a dot, and the name of the method, followed by a pair of parentheses. \\nSome methods require nothing within the parentheses, while others require that you specify argu-ments. Let’s look at some examples.\\n B.72  The method length . The method length  gets the number of characters in a string. For example, \\nsuppose we declare two String  variables as follows:\\nString command = \"Sit Fido!\";  // 9 characters\\nString answer = \"bow-wow\";     // 7 characters\\nNow command.length()  has the value 9 (it returns 9), and answer.length()  returns 7. Notice \\nthat you must include a pair of parentheses, even though there are no arguments to the method \\nlength . Also notice that spaces, special symbols, and repeated characters are all counted in \\ncomputing the length of a string. All characters except the double quotes that enclose the string \\nare counted.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 38}, page_content='The Class String   B-39\\nYou can use a call to the method length  anywhere that you can use a value of type int. For \\nexample, all of the following are legal Java statements:\\nint count = command.length();\\nSystem.out.println(\"Length is \" + command.length());count = answer.length() + 3;\\n B.73  The method concat . You can use the method concat  instead of the + operator to concatenate two \\nstrings. For example, if we declare the String  variables\\nString one = \"sail\";String two = \"boat\";\\nthe expressions\\none + two\\nand\\none.concat(two);\\nare the same string, sailboat.\\n B.74  Indices. Some of the methods in the class String  refer to the positions of the characters in the \\nstring. Positions in a string start with 0, not with 1. Thus, in the string \"Hi Mom\" , H is in position \\n0, i is in position 1, the blank character is in position 2, and so forth. A position is usually referred \\nto as an index. So it would be more normal to say that H  is at index 0, i  is at index 1, and so on. \\nFigure B-5 illustrates how index positions are numbered in a string.\\nFiGUR e B-5 Indices 0 through 11 for the string \"Java is fun.\"\\n01 23 45 67 89 10 11\\nJ a v a i s f u n .\\n B.75  The methods charAt  and indexOf . The method charAt  returns the character at the index given \\nas its one argument. For example, the statements\\nString phrase = \"Time flies like an arrow.\";char sixthCharacter = phrase.charAt(5);\\nassign the character f  to the variable sixthCharacter , since the f  in flies is at index 5. (Remember, \\nthe first index is 0, not 1.)\\nThe method indexOf  tests whether a string contains a given substring and, if it does, returns \\nthe index at which the substring begins. Thus, phrase.indexOf(\"flies\")  will return 5 because \\nthe substring flies begins at index 5 within phrase .\\nNote:  Out-of-bounds index\\nString  methods such as charAt  that take an index as an argument will cause an error during \\n execution if the index is negative or too large. Such an index is said to be out of bounds. The \\n error causes a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException . Java Interludes 2 and 4 discuss exceptions.\\n B.76  Changing case. The method toLowerCase  returns a string obtained from its argument string by \\nreplacing any uppercase letters with their lowercase counterparts. Thus, if greeting  is defined by\\nString greeting = \"Hi Mary!\";\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

An analogous method, toUpperCase , converts any lowercase letters \\nin a string to uppercase. Note the capital C  in toLowerCase  and toUpperCase .\\n B.77  The method trim . The method trim  trims off any leading and trailing white space, such as blanks. \\nSo the statements\\nString command = \"   Sit Fido!    \";\\nString trimmedCommand = command.trim();\\nset trimmedCommand  to the string \"Sit Fido!\" . The blanks between words are not affected.\\n B.78  Comparing strings. You use the method compareTo  to compare two strings. Strings are ordered \\naccording to the Unicode values of their characters. This ordering—called lexicographic ordering—is \\nanalogous to alphabetic ordering. The expression\\nstringOne.compareTo(stringTwo)\\nreturns a negative integer or a positive integer, depending on whether stringOne  occurs before or \\nafter stringTwo . The expression returns zero if the two strings are equal.\\nThe method compareToIgnoreCase  behaves similarly to compareTo , except that the uppercase and \\nlowercase versions of the same letter are considered to be equal. For example, the method compareTo  \\nplaces the string \"Hello\"  before the string \"hello\" , but the method compareToIgnoreCase  finds these \\nstrings to be equal.\\nProgramming Tip:  Do not use the operators ==, !=, <, <=, >, or >= to compare the contents \\nof two strings.\\nIf you want only to see whether two strings are equal—that is, contain the same values—you \\ncan use the method equals . Thus,\\nstringOne.equals(stringTwo)\\nis true if stringOne  equals stringTwo  and is false if they are not equal. The method equals- \\nIgnoreCase  behaves similarly to equals , except that the uppercase and lowercase versions \\nof the same letter are equal. For example, the method equals  finds the strings \"Hello\"  and \\n\"hello\"  unequal, but the method equalsIgnoreCase  finds them equal.\\nProgramming Tip:  When applied to two strings (or to any two objects), the operator == \\ntests whether they are stored in the same memory location. Sometimes that is sufficient, but if  \\nyou want to know whether two strings that are in different memory locations contain the same \\nsequence of characters, use the method equals .\\nThe Class StringBuilder\\n B.79  Once you create a string object of the class String , you cannot alter it. But sometimes you would \\nlike to. For example, we might define the string\\nString name = \"rover\";\\nand then decide that we want to capitalize its first letter. We cannot. We could, of course, write\\nname = \"Rover\";\\nbut this statement creates a new string Rover and discards rover.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

Methods in Scanner —such as nextInt , nextDouble , and next —read a group of \\ncontiguous characters, or token, as an integer, a real number, or a string, respectively. When more \\nthan one token appears in the input data, they are separated by one or more characters known as delimiters. By default, \\nScanner  uses white space as the delimiter.\\nIn addition to reading data from the keyboard, you can use Scanner  to process a string that \\nyou define within your program. You simply use the string instead of System.in  when creating a \\nScanner  object.\\nFor example, the statements\\nString phrase = \"one potato        two    potato three potato four\";\\nScanner scan = new Scanner(phrase);System.out.println(scan.next());System.out.println(scan.next());System.out.println(scan.next());System.out.println(scan.next());\\ndisplay the words\\nonepotatotwopotato\\nWe essentially have read tokens from a string instead of from the keyboard. The tokens here are \\nseparated by white space, the default delimiter.\\n B.82  Specifying delimiters. Whether you read characters from an input device such as a keyboard or from a string defined in your program, you can specify the delimiters that \\nScanner  will use. The \\nScanner  method useDelimiter  sets the delimiters to those indicated in its string argument. For \\nexample, to use a comma as a delimiter, you would write\\nscan.useDelimiter(\",\");\\nwhere scan  is a Scanner  object. Thus, the statements\\nString data = \"one,potato,two,potato\";\\nScanner scan = new Scanner(data);scan.useDelimiter(\",\");System.out.println(scan.next());System.out.println(scan.next());System.out.println(scan.next());System.out.println(scan.next());\\ndisplay the words\\nonepotatotwooptato\\n B.83  Example.

For example, you can create an array of seven numbers of type \\ndouble  as follows:\\ndouble[] temperature = new double[7];\\nThe left side of the assignment operator declares temperature  as an array whose contents are of \\ntype double . The right side uses the new operator to request seven memory locations for the array. \\nThis is like declaring the following strangely named variables to have type double :\\ntemperature[0] , temperature[1] , temperature[2] , temperature[3] ,\\ntemperature[4] , temperature[5] , temperature[6]\\nNote that the numbering starts with 0, not 1. Each of these seven variables can be used just like any other variable of type \\ndouble . For example, we can write\\ntemperature[3] = 32;\\ntemperature[6] = temperature[3] + 5;System.out.println(temperature[6]);\\nBut these seven variables are more than just seven plain old variables of type double . The \\nnumber in square brackets—called an index, or subscript—can be any arithmetic expression whose \\nvalue is an integer. In this example, the index value must be between 0 and 6, because we declared \\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

A variable such as temperature[3]  is \\ncalled either an indexed variable, a subscripted variable, or simply an element of the array. The \\nvalue in an indexed variable is called an entry, and its data type is the array’s entry type.\\nFor example, the following statements read seven temperatures into an array and compare \\nthem with their average:\\npublic static final int DAYS_PER_WEEK = 7;\\nScanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);. . .\\ndouble[] temperature = new double[DAYS_PER_WEEK];System.out.println(\"Enter \" + DAYS_PER_WEEK + \" temperatures:\");\\ndouble sum = 0;for (int index = 0; index < DAYS_PER_WEEK; index++){   temperature[index] = keyboard.nextDouble();   sum = sum + temperature[index];} // end for\\ndouble average = sum / DAYS_PER_WEEK;System.out.println(\"The average temperature is \" + average);\\nSystem.out.println(\"The temperatures are\");for (int index = 0; index < DAYS_PER_WEEK; index++){   if (temperature[index] < average)      System.out.println(temperature[index] + \" below average.\");   else if (temperature[index] > average)      System.out.println(temperature[index] + \" above average.\");   else // temperature[index] == average      System.out.println(temperature[index] + \" average.\");} // end for\\nFigure B-7 illustrates the array temperature  after seven values have been read into it.\\nFiGUR e B-7 An array of seven temperatures\\ntemperature[5]The array temperatureIndices 01 23 45 6\\n32 30 25.7 26 34 31.5 29\\nEach location in the array temperature  contains a temperature.

Notice that length  is not a method, so no parentheses follow it. If we place \\nonly 10 values into the first 10 locations of this array, age.length  is still 50. If we need to know \\nhow many values we place into an array, we will need to keep track of that ourselves.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

You can pass an indexed variable as an argument to a method anyplace that you \\ncan pass an ordinary variable of the array’s entry type. For example, if a method has the header\\npublic double compute(double value)\\nand temperature  is the array of double  values that we defined earlier, we can invoke the method \\nby writing\\ndouble result = compute(temperature[3])\\nAn entire array can also be a single argument to a method. For example, the following method\\npublic static void incrementArrayBy2(double[] array)\\n{   for (int index = 0; index < array.length; index++)      array[index] = array[index] + 2;} // end incrementArrayBy2\\nwill accept any array of double  values as its single argument. We declare the parameter array  in \\nthe method’s header just as we would declare any other array: by specifying the type of the array \\nentries followed by square brackets. We do not specify the length of the array.\\nThe following statement is an example of how we would invoke this method:\\nincrementArrayBy2(temperature);\\nYou use no square brackets when you pass an entire array as an argument to a method. Notice that the method can take any length array as an argument. The method \\nincrementArrayBy2  adds 2 to \\neach entry in the argument array temperature . That is, the method actually changes the values in \\nthe argument array.\\nNote:  A method can change the values in an argument array. However, a method cannot  \\nreplace an argument array with another array.\\n B.88  Arrays as return values. In Java, a method can return an array. For example, rather than modi-fying its array argument, the previous method \\nincrementArrayBy2  could return an array whose \\nvalues are 2 more than the corresponding values in the array argument. You specify the method’s return type in the same way that you specify a type for an array parameter. The method would then look like this:\\npublic static double[] incrementArrayBy2(double[] array)\\n{   double[] result = new double[array.length];   for (int index = 0; index < array.length; index++)      result[index] = array[index] + 2;   return result;} // end incrementArrayBy2\\nThe following statements invoke this method:\\ndouble[] originalArray = new double[10];\\n< Statements that place values into originalArray  >\\n. . .\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

For example, to \\ninvoke the method in the previous example, you do not write\\ndouble[] revisedArray = new double[10]; // WRONG!revisedArray = incrementArrayBy2(originalArray);\\nThe first statement allocates 10 locations for a new array, but these locations are discarded when the second statement executes.\\n Initializing Arrays\\n B.89  You can provide initial values for the elements in an array when you declare it. To do this, you \\nenclose the values for the array in braces and place them after the assignment operator, as in the following example:\\ndouble[] reading = {3.3, 15.8, 9.7};\\nYou do not explicitly state the array’s length. Instead the length is the minimum number of loca-tions that will hold the given values. This initializing declaration is equivalent to the following statements:\\ndouble[] reading = new double[3];\\nreading[0] = 3.3;reading[1] = 15.8;reading[2] = 9.7;\\nIf you do not initialize the elements of an array, they are given initial default values according \\nto their type. For example, if you do not initialize an array of integers, each element of the array \\nwill be initialized to zero. In an array of objects, each element is initialized to null . However, it \\nis usually clearer to do your own explicit initialization, either when you declare the array or later by using a loop and assignment statements.\\n Array Index Out of Bounds\\n B.90  When programming with arrays, making a mistake with an index is easy. This is especially true if that index is an expression. If the array \\ntemperature  has seven elements, but an index \\nis some  integer other than 0 through 6, the index is said to be out of bounds. An out-of-bounds \\nindex expression will compile without any error message, but will cause an error when you run your program. In particular, you will get an \\nIndexOutOfBoundsException . As we mentioned in \\n Segment  B.75, a similar situation can occur when you work with strings. (Java Interludes 2 and 4 \\ndiscuss exceptions.)\\n Use of = and == with Arrays\\n B.91  The operator =. Recall that a variable for an object really contains the memory address of the \\nobject. The same is true of arrays. All array locations are together in one section of memory so that one memory address can specify the location of the entire array. The assignment operator copies this memory address. For example, if \\na and b are arrays of the same size, the assignment \\nb = a gives the array variable b the same memory address as the array variable a. In other words, \\na and b are two different names for the same array. These variables are aliases. Thus, when you \\nchange the value of a[2] , you are also changing the value of b[2] . Appendix C talks more about \\naliases and references.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 47}, page_content='B-48  Appendix B   Java Basics\\nIf you want the array b to have the same values as the array a, but in separate memory loca-\\ntions, then instead of one assignment statement you must use a loop like the following one:\\nfor (int index = 0; index < a.length; index++)\\n   b[index] = a[index];\\n B.92  The operator  ==. The equality operator == tests two arrays to see if they are stored in the same \\nplace in the computer’s memory. It does not test whether the arrays contain the same values. To \\ndo so, you must compare the two arrays entry by entry. For example, if the arrays a and b contain \\nprimitive values and have the same length, the following code could be used:\\nboolean match = true;\\nint index = 0;while (match && (index < a.length)){   if (a[index] != b[index])      match = false;   else      index++;} // end while\\nif (match)\\n   System.out.println(\"Arrays have the same contents\");else   System.out.println(\"Arrays have different contents\");\\nIf the arrays contained objects instead of primitive values, we would use the boolean expression \\n!a[index].equals(b[index])  instead of a[index] != b[index] .\\nNote:  Are arrays really objects?\\nArrays behave very much like objects. On the other hand, arrays do not belong to any class. \\n Because arrays were used by programmers for many years before classes and objects (as we have used them) were invented, arrays use a special notation of their own. Other features of \\n objects do not apply to arrays, such as inheritance (which we discuss in Appendix D). So \\n whether or not arrays should be considered objects is primarily an academic debate. Whenever Java documentation says that something applies to all objects, it also applies to arrays.\\nNote:  Array types are reference types\\nA variable of an array type holds only the address where the array is stored in memory. This memory address is often called a reference to the array object in memory. For this reason, an \\n array type is a reference type. A reference type is any type whose variables hold references—that is, memory addresses—as opposed to the actual item named by the variable. Array types and class types are both reference types. Primitive types are not reference types.\\n Arrays and the For-Each Loop\\n B.93  Earlier in Segment B.63 we used a for-each loop to process all the values in an enumeration. We \\ncan use a similar for-each loop to process all the values in an array. For example, the following statements compute the sum of the integers in an array:\\nint[] anArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\\nint sum = 0;\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

For example, suppose we wanted to store the \\ndollar amounts shown in Figure B-8 in some sort of array. The bold items are just labeling. There are 60 entries. If we use an array with one index, the array will have a length of 60, and keeping track of which entry goes with which index would be almost impossible. On the other hand, if we allow ourselves two indices, we can use one index for the row and one index for the column. This arrangement is illustrated in Figure B-9.\\nFiGUR e B-8 A table of values\\nThe effect of various interest rates on $1000 when \\ncompounded annually (rounded to whole dollars )\\nYear 5.00% 5.50% 6.00% 6.50% 7.00% 7.50%\\n1 $105 0 $105 5 $106 0 $106 5 $107 0 $107 5\\n2 $110 3 $111 3 $112 4 $113 4 $114 5 $115 6\\n3 $115 8 $117 4 $119 1 $120 8 $122 5 $124 2\\n4 $121 6 $123 9 $126 2 $128 6 $131 1 $133 5\\n5 $127 6 $130 7 $133 8 $137 0 $140 3 $143 6\\n6 $134 0 $137 9 $141 9 $145 9 $150 1 $154 3\\n7 $140 7 $145 5 $150 4 $155 4 $160 6 $165 9\\n8 $147 7 $153 5 $159 4 $165 5 $171 8 $178 3\\n9 $155 1 $161 9 $168 9 $176 3 $183 8 $191 7\\n10 $162 9 $170 8 $179 1 $187 7 $196 7 $206 1\\nNote that, as was true for the simple arrays you have already seen, you begin numbering \\nindices with 0 rather than 1. If the array is named table  and it has two indices, the Java notation \\ntable[3][2]  specifies the entry in the fourth row and third column. By convention, we think of \\nthe first index as denoting the row and the second as denoting the column. Arrays that have exactly two indices can be displayed on paper as a two-dimensional table and are called two-dimensional arrays. More generally, an array is said to be an n -dimensional array if it has n  indices. Thus, the \\nordinary one-index arrays that we have used up to now are one-dimensional arrays.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

To declare and create \\nthe array table  with 10 rows and 6 columns, we write\\nint[][] table = new int[10][6];\\nYou can have arrays with any number of indices. To get more indices, you just use more square brackets in the declaration.\\nIndexed variables for multidimensional arrays are just like indexed variables for one-dimen-\\nsional arrays, except that they have multiple indices, each enclosed in a pair of square brackets. For example, the following statements set all the elements in \\ntable  to zero:\\nfor (int row = 0; row < 10; row++)\\n   for (int column = 0; column < 6; column++)      table[row][column] = 0;\\nNote that we used two for loops, one nested within the other. This is a common way of stepping \\nthrough the indexed variables in a two-dimensional array. If we had three indices, we would use \\nthree nested for loops, and so forth for higher numbers of indices.\\nAs was true of the indexed variables for one-dimensional arrays, indexed variables for multi-\\ndimensional arrays are variables of the array’s entry type and can be used anywhere that a variable of the entry type is allowed. For example, for the two-dimensional array \\ntable , an indexed vari-\\nable such as table[3][2]  is a variable of type int and can be used anyplace that an ordinary int \\nvariable can be used.\\nA multidimensional array can be a parameter of a method. For example, the following method \\nheader has a two-dimensional array as a parameter:\\npublic static void clearArray(double[][] array)\\n B.96  Java implements multidimensional arrays as one-dimensional arrays. For example, consider the array\\nint[][] table = new int[10][6];\\nThe array table  is in fact a one-dimensional array of length 10, and its entry type is int[] . Thus, \\neach entry in the array table  is a one-dimensional array of length 6. In other words, a multidimen-\\nsional array is an array of arrays.\\nNormally, you do not need to be concerned with this fact, since this detail is handled auto-\\nmatically by the compiler. However, sometimes you can profit from this knowledge. For example, consider the previous nested \\nfor loops that filled the two-dimensional array table  with zeros. We \\nused the constants 6 and 10 to control the for loops, but it would be better style to use the data \\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

To do so, we need to think in terms of an array of arrays. For example, the \\nfollowing is a rewrite of the nested for loops:\\nfor (int row = 0; row < table.length; row++)\\n   for (int column = 0; column < table[row].length; column++)      table[row][column] = 0;\\nHere, table.length  is the number of rows in table , and table[row].length  is the number of columns.\\nWrapper Classes\\n B.97  Java makes a distinction between the primitive types, such as int, double , and char , and the class \\ntypes, such as String  and the classes that you write. Java sometimes treats primitive types and class \\ntypes differently. For example, an argument to a method and the assignment operator = behave dif-\\nferently for primitive types and class types. To make things uniform, Java provides a wrapper class \\nfor each of the primitive types that enables us to convert a value of a primitive type to an object of a corresponding class type.\\nFor example, the wrapper class for the primitive type \\nint is the predefined class Integer . If \\nwe want to convert an int value, such as 10, to an object of type Integer , we can do so in one of \\nthree ways, as the following statements demonstrate:\\nInteger ten = new Integer(10);\\nInteger fiftyTwo = new Integer(\"52\");Integer eighty = 80;\\nIn the first way, you supply an int value as a literal, a variable, or an expression. In the second, \\nyou provide a string that contains an int value. The third way allows you to simply assign an int \\nvalue without using the new operator.\\n B.98  Once you have defined Integer  objects, you can compare them by using the methods compareTo  \\nand equals , much as you compare strings or the other objects we have discussed in this appendix. \\nDo not use operators such as ==. Just as for strings and other objects, operators like == compare \\nthe memory addresses of objects, not their values.\\nIf you need the value of an Integer  object as a primitive, you can use methods such as intValue  \\nor doubleValue . For example, if ten is defined as in the previous segment, the expression\\nten.intValue()\\nreturns the int value 10, whereas\\nten.doubleValue()\\nreturns the double  value 10.0. You also can simply assign the Integer  object to an int variable, as in\\nint primitive10 = ten;\\nNo type cast is necessary; however, using one is not an error.\\n B.99  Boxing and unboxing. When performing arithmetic with Integer  objects, for example, you can \\nuse the same operators that you use for arithmetic with primitives. You can also intermix primitive \\nintegers with Integer  objects. Thus, you can write statements such as the following:\\nScanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);\\nSystem.out.print(\"What is his age? \");int hisAge = keyboard.nextInt();System.out.print(\"What is her age? \");Integer herAge = keyboard.nextInt();\\nInteger ageDifference = Math.abs(hisAge - herAge);\\nSystem.out.println(\"He is \" + hisAge + \", she is \" + herAge +                   \": a difference of \" + ageDifference + \".\");\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

The process of converting from a primitive \\ntype to a corresponding wrapper class is called boxing. Unboxing is the process used to convert in \\nthe other direction. Since these conversions happen automatically, they are often called auto-boxing \\nand auto-unboxing. Realize that the previous statements are just a demonstration of what is pos-\\nsible. Using only primitive integers for this simple computation is certainly adequate.\\n B.100  The wrapper classes for the primitive types double , float , long , and char  are Double , Float , \\nLong , and Character , respectively. You create objects of these classes in a way analogous to how \\nyou create Integer  objects. Except for Character , each wrapper class has methods that return a \\nvalue in a variety of types. Integer  has the methods doubleValue , floatValue , intValue , and \\nlongValue . Double , Float , and Long  also have these same methods. The class Character  has only \\nthe analogous method charValue .\\nMany of the classes that we study in this book represent collections of objects. If your data \\nhas a primitive type, an appropriate wrapper class enables you to represent the data as objects so that you can use these classes.\\n B.101  Wrapper classes also contain some useful static constants. For example, you can find the largest and smallest values of any of the primitive number types by using the associated wrapper class. The largest and smallest values of type \\nint are\\nInteger.MAX_VALUE and Integer.MIN_VALUE\\nThe largest and smallest values of type double  are\\nDouble.MAX_VALUE and Double.MIN_VALUE\\n B.102  Wrapper classes have static methods that can be used to convert a string to the corresponding number of type \\nint, double , long , or float . For example, suppose your program needs to convert \\nthe string \"199.98\"  to a double  value (which will turn out to be 199.98, of course). The static \\nmethod parseDouble  of the wrapper class Double  will convert a string to a value of type double . \\nSo if theString  is a variable of type String  whose value is \"199.98\" ,\\nDouble.parseDouble(theString)\\nreturns the double  value 199.98. The other wrapper classes Integer , Long , and Float  have the \\nanalogous methods parseInt , parseLong , and parseFloat .\\nIf there is any possibility that the string named by theString  has extra leading or trailing \\nblanks, you should instead use\\nDouble.parseDouble(theString.trim())\\nAs we discussed in Segment B.77, the method trim , included in the class String , trims off \\nleading or trailing white space, such as blanks. If the string is not a correctly formed number, the invocation of \\nDouble.parseDouble  will cause an exception. The use of trim  helps some in \\navoiding this problem.\\n B.103  Each of the numeric wrapper classes also has a static method called toString  that will convert in \\nthe other direction—that is, it will convert from a primitive numeric value to a string representa-tion of the numeric value. For example,\\nInteger.toString(42)\\nreturns the string value \"42\" , and\\nDouble.toString(199.98)\\nreturns the string value \"199.98\" . Additionally, each wrapper class, like all other classes, has a \\nnonstatic version of toString . For example, if we define n as follows:\\nInteger n = new Integer(198);\\nthen n.toString()  returns the string \"198\" .\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

Wrapper classes allow you to represent values of a \\nprimitive type as a class type. They also contain a number of useful predefined constants and methods.\\n B.104  Character  is the wrapper class for the primitive type char . The following piece of code illustrates \\nsome of the basic methods for this class:\\nCharacter c1 = new Character(\\'a\\');Character c2 = new Character(\\'A\\');if (c1.equals(c2))   System.out.println(c1.charValue() + \" is the same as \" + c2.charValue());\\nelse\\n   System.out.println(c1.charValue() + \" is not the same as \" + c2.charValue());\\nThis code displays\\na is not the same as A\\nThe equals  method checks for equality of characters, so uppercase and lowercase letters are con-\\nsidered different.\\nSome of the static methods in the class Character  follow:\\npublic static char toLowerCase(char ch)\\nReturns the lowercase equivalent of ch, if ch is a letter; otherwise returns ch.\\nExamples:\\nCharacter.toLowerCase(\\'a\\')  returns \\'a\\'\\nCharacter.toLowerCase(\\'A\\')  returns \\'a\\'\\nCharacter.toLowerCase(\\'5\\')  returns \\'5\\'\\npublic static char toUpperCase(char ch)\\nReturns the uppercase equivalent of ch, if ch is a letter; otherwise returns ch.\\nExamples:\\nCharacter.toUpperCase(\\'a\\')  returns \\'A\\'\\nCharacter.toUpperCase(\\'A\\')  returns \\'A\\'\\nCharacter.toUpperCase(\\'5\\')  returns \\'5\\'\\npublic static boolean isLowerCases(char ch)\\nReturns true if ch is a lowercase letter.\\nExamples:\\nCharacter.isLowerCase(\\'a\\')  returns true\\nCharacter.isLowerCase(\\'A\\')  returns false\\nCharacter.isLowerCase(\\'5\\')  returns false\\npublic static boolean isUpperCase(char ch)\\nReturns true if ch is an uppercase letter.\\nExamples:\\nCharacter.isUpperCase(\\'a\\')  returns false\\nCharacter.isUpperCase(\\'A\\')  returns true\\nCharacter.isUpperCase(\\'5\\')  returns false\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

This class has the two constants Boolean.TRUE  and \\n Boolean.FALSE . However, the Java reserved words true  and false  are much easier to use for \\nthese constants. So the constants in the class Boolean  will not be of much help to us. The methods \\nof the class Boolean  are also not used very often.

You also should indent the second line to make the entire statement \\neasier to read.\\nLater, in the section about the class String , you will see that the + operator joins, or \\n concatenates, two strings.

These methods are static methods. (Segment C.28 of Appendix C dis-\\ncusses static methods in more detail.) When you invoke a static method, you write the class name—\\nMath , in this case—a dot, the name of the method, and a pair of parentheses. Using the \\nname of a class to invoke a method is not typical. Ordinarily, you use the name of an object to invoke a method.\\nMost \\nMath  methods require that you specify items within the pair of parentheses. As we noted \\nearlier in this appendix, these items are called arguments to the method. Thus, a typical invocation of a method in this class has the form \\nMath. method_name (arguments ).\\nYou can invoke the method in an assignment statement, such as\\nvariable = Math. method_name (arguments );\\nor embed it within an arithmetic expression. That is, you can use Math. method_name (arguments ) \\nanyplace that you can use a variable of a primitive data type. Figure B-2 describes some of the available methods in this class.\\nThe class \\nMath  also has two predefined named constants. E is the base of the natural logarithm \\nsystem—often written e  in mathematical formulas—and is approximately 2.72. PI is used in cal-\\nculations involving circular geometric figures—often written π in mathematical formulas—and is approximately 3.14159. Because these constants are defined in the class \\nMath , you use them by \\nwriting Math.E  and Math.PI .\\nSimple input and Output Using the Keyboard and Screen\\nThe input and output of data is usually referred to as I /O. A Java program can perform I/O in \\nmany different ways. In this section, we present some ways to handle simple text input that we type at the keyboard and simple text output displayed on the screen.\\n Screen Output\\n B.30  Statements like\\nSystem.out.println(\"Enter a whole number from 1 to 99.\");\\nand\\nSystem.out.println(quarters + \" quarters\");\\nsend output to the display screen. As we mentioned earlier in this appendix, System.out  is an \\nobject within the class System , which is a class in the Java Class Library. This object has println  \\nas one of its methods. So the preceding output statements are calls to the method println  of \\nthe object System.out . You simply follow System.out.println  with a pair of parentheses that \\ncontain what you want to display. You end the statement with a semicolon.\\nWithin the parentheses can be strings of text in double quotes, like \"Enter a whole number \\nfrom 1 to 99.\" , variables like quarters , numbers like 5 or 7.3, and almost any other object \\nor value. To display more than one thing, simply place a + operator between them. For example,\\nSystem.out.println(\"Lucky number = \" + 13 +\\n                   \"Secret number = \" + number);\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'),\n",

The compiler does not know that we mean to include the \\nquote character as part of the string unless we tell it that we want to do so. We tell the compiler this by placing a backslash \\n\\\\ before the troublesome character, like so:\\nSystem.out.println(\"The word \\\\\"Java\\\\\" names a language and a drink!\");\\nSome other special characters also need a backslash in order to be included in strings. They \\nare listed in Figure B-4.

To use Scanner  in your \\nprogram, you must import it from this package by writing the following import  statement before \\nthe rest of your program:\\nimport java.util.Scanner;\\nBefore you can use any of the methods in Scanner , you must create a Scanner  object by writ-\\ning a statement such as\\nScanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);\\nThe variable keyboard —which could be any variable of your choosing—is assigned a Scanner  \\nobject that is associated with the input device that System.in  represents. This device by conven-\\ntion is the keyboard. The variable keyboard  has a class type.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved')]\n",

If you know some other pro-\\ngramming language, this appendix will help you to learn Java by reviewing the essential elements \\nof the language. Appendixes C, D, and E supplement the coverage of Java that is presented here by discussing methods, classes, inheritance, and file I/O.\\nIf you already know Java, note that this book uses applications, not applets. If you know only \\nabout applets, you should read at least the first few pages of this appendix.\\nintroduction\\n Applications and Applets\\n B.1 There are two kinds of Java programs, applications and applets. An application is simply a pro-gram that runs on your computer like any other program. It is a stand-alone program. In contrast, an applet is a program that cannot run without the support of a browser or a viewer. Typically, an \\napplet is sent to another location on the Internet and is run there. The term “applet” is meant to suggest a little application.\\nApplets and applications are almost identical. Once you know how to design and write one, it \\nis easy to learn to write the other. This book uses applications rather than applets.\\n Objects and Classes\\n B.2 An object is a program construct that contains data and can perform certain actions. When a Java \\nprogram is run, the objects interact with one another to accomplish a particular task. The actions performed by objects are defined by methods in the program. When you ask an object to perform \\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

Java has two kinds of methods. A valued method uses a \\nreturn  statement to return a result, but a void method does not.\\nAll objects of the same kind are said to be in the same class. So a class is a category or kind \\nor type of object. All objects in the same class have the same types of data and the same methods.\\nYou will see some objects and methods in the next section and again when we discuss the \\nclasses Math , Scanner , and String  later in this appendix. Appendix C reviews classes, objects, \\nand methods in more detail. If you are not familiar with these concepts, you should read at least \\nSegment C.1 in Appendix C now and the rest of Appendix C later.\\n A First Java Application Program\\n B.3 To give you a feel for the Java language, let’s take a brief, informal look at the following sample Java application program:\\nimport java.util.Scanner;\\npublic class FirstProgram{   public static void main(String[] args)   {      Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);      System.out.println(\"Hello out there.\");      System.out.println(\"Want to talk some more?\");      System.out.println(\"Answer yes or no.\");\\n      String answer = keyboard.next();\\n      if (answer.equals(\"yes\"))         System.out.println(\"Nice weather we are having.\");      System.out.println(\"Good-bye.\");   } // end main} // end FirstProgram\\nThe program is stored in the file FirstProgram.java .\\nFigure B-1 shows two screen displays that might be produced when a user runs and interacts \\nwith this program. The text typed by the user is shown in bold.\\nFiGUR e B-1  Two possible results when running the sample program\\nHello out there.\\nWant to talk some more?Answer yes or no.yesNice weather we are having.Good-bye.Hello out there.Want to talk some more?Answer yes or no.noGood-bye.\\n B.4 This program uses the class Scanner , which is a part of the Java Class Library. This library con-\\ntains many standard classes that you can use in your Java programs. The classes in the library are organized into groups called packages. The \\nimport  statement indicates that this program uses the \\nclass Scanner  from the package java.util .\\nThe program contains the definition of a class that begins with the lines\\npublic class FirstProgram\\n{\\nand ends with\\n} // end FirstProgram\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='B-4  Appendix B   Java Basics\\nWithin the class definition is a method called main  that begins with the statements\\npublic static void main(String[] args)\\n{\\nand ends with\\n} // end main\\nStatements within this pair of braces are the body of the method main . Generally, a class con-\\ntains several methods, each defining a specific task and each having a name of our choosing. An \\napplication program, however, must contain a method that is called main .\\n B.5 The line\\nScanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);\\ngets us ready to read data from the keyboard using Java’s class Scanner . It defines the  Scanner  \\nobject keyboard  and associates it with the object System.in . This latter object represents the \\ncomputer’s keyboard. System.in  is in the class System , which is in the package java.lang  of the \\nJava Class Library.\\nProgramming Tip:  No import  statement is necessary when you use a class from the \\n package java.lang  of the Java Class Library.\\n B.6 The next three lines display text for the user of the program:\\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello out there.\");\\nSystem.out.println(\"Want to talk some more?\");System.out.println(\"Answer yes or no.\");\\nEach of these lines causes the quoted characters, or string, given within the parentheses to be \\ndisplayed on the screen. System.out  is an object within the class System  that can send output to \\nthe screen via its method println . You invoke an object’s method by writing the object name fol-\\nlowed by a period, or dot, followed by the method name and some parentheses that may or may not have something inside them. The text inside the parentheses is called an argument and provides the information the method needs to carry out its action. In each of these three lines, the method \\nprintln  writes the value of its argument—here, the characters inside the quotes—to the screen.\\nThe method println  is an example of a void method. It performs an action, but does not \\nreturn a value.\\n B.7 The next line of the program reads the characters that are typed at the keyboard and stores them in the variable \\nanswer  as a string:\\nString answer = keyboard.next();\\nYou use the Scanner  object keyboard  to invoke its method next . In this way, you read the word \\nthat the user types at the keyboard. The user presses the Enter key (also called the Return key) after typing the word. Although the method \\nnext  has no arguments, the parentheses are required. \\nYou will learn more about the class Scanner  later in this appendix.\\nThe method next  is an example of a valued method. It returns the value read. Its invocation, \\nkeyboard.next() , represents this value.\\n B.8 The next two lines of the program make a decision to do or not do something based on the value of the variable \\nanswer . The first line asks whether the string stored in answer  is the string yes . If \\nit is, a message is displayed on the screen. Otherwise, the message is not displayed.\\nNotice that the first sample dialogue in Figure B-1 displays the string Nice weather we are \\n having, and the second one does not. That is because, in the first run of the program, the string yes is \\nstored in the variable answer , and in the second run of the program, the string no is stored in answer .\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

For example, a final \\nsemicolon ends each Java statement. These rules form the grammar for the Java language, just as there are rules for the grammar of the English language. The grammar rules for a programming language (or any language) are called the syntax of the language. We now look at the elements of Java in more detail.\\nelements of Java\\nIn this section, we examine how to use Java to perform arithmetic computations.\\n\\t Identifiers\\n B.10  You use identifiers to name certain parts of a program. An identifier in Java consists entirely of letters, digits, the underscore character \\n_, and the dollar sign $. An identifier cannot start with a \\ndigit and must not contain a space or any other special character such as a period or an  asterisk. \\nThere is no official limit to the length of a name, though in practice, there is always a limit. Although Java allows identifiers to contain a dollar sign, it is reserved for special purposes, and so you should not use $ in a Java identifier.\\nJava is case sensitive. This means that it treats uppercase letters and lowercase letters as \\ndifferent characters. For example, \\nmystuff , myStuff , and MyStuff  are three different identifiers. \\nHaving these identifiers in the same program could be confusing to human readers, and therefore doing so is a poor programming practice. But the Java compiler would be happy with them.\\nJava uses a character set, called Unicode, that includes characters from languages other than \\nEnglish. Java allows you to use these extra characters in identifiers, but you are not likely to find them on most keyboards. Segment B.68 discusses Unicode further.\\n B.11  Although it is not required by the Java language, the common practice, and the one followed in this book, is to start the names of classes with uppercase letters and to start the names of objects, methods, and variables (which you are about to see) with lowercase letters. These names are usu -\\nally spelled using only letters and digits. We separate multiword names by using uppercase letters, since we cannot use spaces. For example, the following are all legal identifiers that follow this well-established convention:\\ninputStream   YourClass   CarWash   hotCar   theTimeOfDay\\nSome people use an underscore to separate the words in an identifier , but typically we will not.\\nThe following are all illegal identifiers in Java, and the compiler will complain if you use any \\nof them:\\n.MyClass   goTeam-   7eleven\\nThe first two contain an illegal character, either a dot or a dash. The last name is illegal because it starts with a digit.\\n Reserved Words\\n B.12  Some words, such as the word if, have a special predefined meaning in the Java language. You \\ncannot use these words, called reserved words or keywords, for anything other than their intended meaning. A full list of reserved words for Java is given on the inside cover of this book. Within a programming environment, the names of reserved words are often highlighted in some way. In this book, they will appear in boldface.\\nSome other words, such as \\nString , name classes that are supplied with Java. They have a \\npredefined meaning but are not reserved words. This means that you can change their meaning, but doing so could easily confuse you or somebody else reading your program.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='B-6  Appendix B   Java Basics\\n Variables\\n B.13  A variable in a program represents a memory location that stores data such as numbers and letters. \\nThe number, letter, or other data item in a variable is called its value. This value can be changed, \\nso that at one time the variable contains, say, 6, and at another time after the program has run for a while, the variable contains a different value, such as 4.\\nYou use an identifier to name a variable. Besides following the rules and conventions for \\nidentifiers, you should choose variable names that suggest their use or the kind of data they will hold. For example, if a variable is used to count something, you might name the variable \\ncount . \\nIf the variable is used to hold the speed of an automobile, you might call the variable speed . You \\nshould almost never use single-letter variable names like x and y. Also by convention, variable \\nnames begin with a lowercase letter.\\n B.14  A variable’s data type—or simply type—determines what kind of value the variable can hold. If the type is \\nint, the variable can hold integers. If the type is double , the variable can hold numbers \\nwith a decimal point and a fractional part after the decimal point. If the type is char , the variable \\ncan hold any one character from the computer keyboard.\\nJava has two kinds of types, primitive types and reference types. A primitive type represents \\nsimple, indecomposable values, such as a single number or a single letter. The types int, double , \\nand char  are primitive types. A reference type represents a reference, or a memory address, \\ninstead of the actual item stored at that address. A class type—which is a type for objects of a class—is a reference type. For example, \\nString  is a class type. A variable of a reference type is \\ncalled a reference variable. A second kind of reference type is an array type. We will discuss \\narrays in Segment B.86.\\nNote:  Naming conventions help you to distinguish among identifiers when reading a program.  \\nBy convention, variables begin with a lowercase letter, as do the names of primitive types. The \\nnames of class types begin with an uppercase letter.\\n B.15  A variable declaration indicates the type of data the variable will hold. Different types of data \\nare stored in the computer’s memory in different ways. Variable declarations are necessary so \\nthat the value of a variable can be correctly stored in or retrieved from the computer’s memory. Even though the mechanisms for storing values in the variables of class types differ from the \\n mechanisms used for primitive types, you declare variables for class types and primitive types in the same way.\\nYou declare a variable by writing a type name followed by a list of variable names separated \\nby commas and ending with a semicolon. All the variables named in the list will have the type given at the start of the declaration. For example:\\nint numberOfBaskets, eggsPerBasket, totalEggs;\\nString myName;\\nThe first line declares that the three variables numberOfBaskets , eggsPerBasket , and totalEggs  \\nwill contain values of type int. The second line declares that myName  will store a String  object.\\nYou must declare a variable in a Java program before you use it. Normally, you declare a vari-\\nable either just before it is used or at the start of a method definition.\\n Primitive Types\\n B.16  A whole number without a decimal point, such as 0, 1, or −2, is called an integer. A number with \\na decimal point, such as 3.14159, −8.63, or 5.0, is called a floating-point \\tnumber. Notice that 5.0 \\nis a floating-point number, not an integer. If a number has a fractional part, even if the fractional \\npart is zero, it is a floating-point number.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='elements of Java   B-7\\nAll the Java primitive types appear inside the cover of this book. Notice that there are four \\ntypes for integers—namely byte , short , int, and long . The only difference among the various \\ninteger types is the range of integers they can store and the amount of computer memory they use. \\nIf you cannot decide which integer type to use, use the type int. It has a large enough range for \\nmost purposes and does not use as much memory as the type long .\\nJava has two types for floating-point numbers, float  and double . If you cannot decide \\n between the types float  and double , use double . It allows a wider range of values and is used as \\na default type for floating-point numbers.\\nYou use the primitive type char  for single characters, such as letters, digits, or punctuation. \\nFor example, the following declares the variable symbol  to be of type char , stores the character \\nfor uppercase A  in symbol , and then displays that value—the A —on the screen:\\nchar symbol;\\nsymbol = \\'A\\';System.out.println(symbol);\\nNotice that we enclose the character A  in single quotes. Again note that uppercase letters and low-\\nercase letters are different characters. For example, \\'a\\' and \\'A\\' represent two different characters.\\nFinally, the primitive type boolean  has two values, true and false. You can use a variable of \\ntype boolean  to store the answer to a true /false question such as “Is myTime  less than yourTime ?”\\n Constants\\n B.17  A variable can have its value changed; its value varies. A literal number like 2 cannot change. It is \\nalways 2. It is never 3. Values like 2 or 4.8 are called constants, or literals, because their values \\ndo not change.\\nYou write constants of integer types with an optional plus sign or minus sign, but without \\ncommas or decimal points. Floating-point constants have an optional plus sign or a minus sign and no commas. You can write a floating-point constant in one of two ways. One way looks like the everyday way of writing numbers. For example, \\n9.8, -3.14 , and 5.0 are floating-point con-\\nstants, because they contain a decimal point. The second way is to include a multiplier that is a power of 10. You use the letter \\ne to represent both the multiplication sign and the 10. For example, \\nthe number 8.65 × 108 appears in Java as 8.65e8  (or in the less convenient form 865000000.0 ). \\nThe two forms, 8.65e8  and 865000000.0 , are equivalent in a Java program. Similarly, the number \\n4.83 × 10-4, which is equal to 0.000483, can be written as 4.83e-4  in Java.\\nThe e stands for “exponent,” since it is followed by a number that is thought of as an exponent \\nof 10. The number before the e can be a number with or without a decimal point. The number after \\nthe e cannot contain a decimal point.\\nOther types of literal expressions are also called constants. You write constants of type char  \\nby placing the character within single quotes. For example, \\'Y\\' is a constant of type char . A string \\nconstant is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes, as in \"Java\" .\\n Assignment Statements\\n B.18  You can use an assignment statement to give a value to a variable. For example, if answer  is a \\nvariable of type int and we want to give it the value 42, we could use the following assignment \\nstatement:\\nanswer = 42;\\nAn assignment statement always consists of a single variable on the left-hand side of an equal sign and an expression on the right-hand side followed by a semicolon. The expression can be another variable, a constant, or a more complicated expression made up by combining operators, such as \\n+ and *, with variables and constants. The value of the expression is assigned to the variable on \\nthe left of the equal sign.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content=\"B-8  Appendix B   Java Basics\\nFor example, the following are all examples of assignment statements:\\namount = 3.99;\\nfirstInitial = 'B';score = numberOfCards + handicap;\\nHere we assume that amount  is a variable of type double , firstInitial  is of type char , and the \\nrest of the variables are of type int. If the variable numberOfCards  has the value 7 and handicap  \\nhas the value 2, the value of the variable score  is 9.\\nThe equal sign, =, which is called the assignment operator, does not mean equality. You can \\nthink of the assignment operator as saying, “Make the value of the variable equal to what follows.” \\nFor example, in the statement\\neggsPerBasket = eggsPerBasket - 2;\\nthe variable eggsPerBasket  occurs on both sides of the assignment operator. This statement sub-\\ntracts 2 from the present value of eggsPerBasket  and assigns the new value to eggsPerBasket . In \\neffect, the statement decreases the value of eggsPerBasket  by 2.\\n B.19  A variable that has been declared but that has not yet been given a value by the program is \\n uninitialized. Such a variable might literally have no value, or it might have some default value. For example, an integer variable might have a default value of zero, and a reference variable might have a default value of \\nnull , which is a predefined constant in Java. However, your program will \\nbe clearer if you explicitly give the variable a value, even if you are simply reassigning it the default value. (The exact details on default values have been known to change and should not be counted on.)\\nOne easy way to ensure that you do not have an uninitialized variable is to initialize it within \\nthe declaration. Simply combine the declaration and an assignment statement, as in the following examples:\\nint count = 0;\\ndouble taxRate = 0.075;char grade = 'A';int balance = 1000, newBalance;\\nNote that a single declaration, such as the last statement, can initialize some variables and not others.\\nSometimes the compiler may complain that you have failed to initialize a variable. In most \\ncases, this is indeed true. Occasionally, the compiler is mistaken about this. However, the  compiler \\nwill not compile your program until you convince it that the variable in question is initialized. To \\nmake the compiler happy, initialize the variable when it is declared, even if the variable will be given a different value before you use it for anything. In such cases, you cannot argue with the compiler.\\nNote:  A reference variable that contains null  does not reference any object.\\nAssignment Compatibilities\\n B.20  You cannot put a square peg in a round hole, and similarly you cannot put a value of one type in a variable of another type. You cannot put an \\nint value like 42 in a variable of type char . You can-\\nnot put a double  value like 3.5 in a variable of type int. You cannot even put the double  value 3.0 \\nin a variable of type int. You cannot store a value of one type in a variable of another type unless \\nthe value is somehow converted to match the type of the variable.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='elements of Java   B-9\\nWhen dealing with numbers, however, this conversion will sometimes—but not always—be \\nperformed for you automatically. For example, you can always assign a value of an integer type to \\na variable of a floating-point type, such as when you write either\\ndouble interestRate = 7;\\nor\\nint wholeRate = 7;\\ndouble interestRate = wholeRate;\\nMore generally, you can assign a value of any type on the following list to a variable of any \\ntype that appears further down on the list:\\nbyte → short → int → long → float → double\\nFor example, you can assign a value of type long  to a variable whose type is either long , float , \\nor double . Notice that you can assign a value of any integer type to a variable of any floating-point \\ntype. This is not an arbitrary ordering of the types. As you move down the list from left to right, \\nthe types become more complex, or wider, either because they allow larger values or because they allow decimal points in the numbers. Thus, you can assign a value of one type to a variable of either the same type or a wider type.\\nIn addition, you can assign a value of type \\nchar  to a variable of type int or to any of the \\nnumeric types that follow int in the previous list of types. However, we do not advise doing so, \\nbecause the result could be confusing.1\\nIf you want to assign a value of type double  to a variable of type int, you must change the \\ntype of the value explicitly by using a type cast, as we explain next.\\n Type Casting\\n B.21  A type cast is the changing of the type of a value to some other type, such as changing the type \\nof 2.0 from double  to int. The previous segment described when a change in type is done for you \\nautomatically. In all other cases, if you want to assign a value of one type to a variable of another type, you must perform a type cast. For example, you cannot simply assign a value of type \\ndouble  \\nto a variable of type int, even if the value of type double  happens to have all zeros after the decimal \\npoint and so is conceptually a whole number. Thus, the second of the following statements is illegal:\\ndouble distance = 9.0;\\nint points = distance; // ILLEGAL\\nTo cast the type of distance  to int, you enclose int within parentheses and place it in front of \\ndistance . For example, we would replace the preceding illegal assignment with\\nint points = (int)distance; // Casting from double to int\\nNote that when you type-cast from any floating-point type to any integer type, the value is not \\nrounded. The part after the decimal point is simply discarded, or truncated. For example, if the \\nvariable distance  contains 25.86, (int)distance  has an int value of 25. A type cast does not \\nreally change the value of a variable; distance  is still 25.86, but points  is 25.\\nRecall that when you assign an integer value to a variable of a floating-point type, the type \\ncast is done automatically for you.\\n1. Readers who have used certain other languages, such as C or C++, may be surprised to learn that we cannot \\nassign a value of type char to a variable of type byte. This is because Java uses the Unicode character set rather than \\nthe ASCII character set, and so Java reserves two bytes of memory for each value of type char, but naturally reserves \\nonly one byte of memory for values of type byte. This is one of the few cases where we might notice that Java uses \\nthe Unicode character set. Indeed, if we convert from an int to a char or vice versa, we can expect to get the usual \\ncorrespondence of ASCII numbers and characters.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='B-10  Appendix B   Java Basics\\nNote:  When casting, some programmers place a space before the variable, as in (int) sum . \\nWe prefer to treat casting much like a minus sign. Just as we write minus five as –5, we cast sum \\nto an integer by writing (int)sum .\\n Arithmetic Operators and Expressions\\n B.22  In Java, you perform arithmetic by using the arithmetic operators +, -, *, /, and %. You combine \\nvariables and constants with these operators and parentheses to form an arithmetic expression. \\nThe variables and constants in an expression are called operands. Spaces around the operators, operands, and parentheses within an expression are ignored.\\nA unary operator is one that has only one operand, like the operator \\n– in the assignment \\nstatement\\nbankBalance = -cost;\\nA binary operator has two operands, like the operators + and * in\\ntotal = cost + (tax * discount);\\nNote that the operators – and + can be used as both unary and binary operators.\\nThe meaning of an expression is basically what you expect it to be, but there are some subtle -\\nties about the type of the result and occasionally even about the value of the result. The type of the value produced when an expression is evaluated depends on the types of the values being combined. Consider an expression with only two operands, such as\\namount – adjustment\\nIf both amount  and adjustment  are of type int, the result of the subtraction has type int. If either \\namount  or adjustment , or both, is of type double , the result is of type double . If we replace the \\noperator – with any of the operators +, *, /, or %, the type of the result is determined in the same \\nway. However, the operator % is typically used with integers, as you will see soon.\\nLarger expressions using more than two operands are viewed as a series of steps, each of \\nwhich involves only two operands. For example, to evaluate the expression\\nbalance + (balance * rate)\\nwe evaluate balance * rate  and obtain a number, and then we add that number to balance . Thus, \\nif balance  is int and rate  is double , balance * rate  is double  and so is the entire expression.\\nNote:  If all the items in an arithmetic expression have the same type, the result has that type. \\nIf at least one of the items has a floating-point type, the result has a floating-point type.\\nKnowing whether the value produced has an integer type or a floating-point type is typically \\nall that you need. However, if you need to know the exact type of the value produced by an arith -\\nmetic expression, you can use the following rule:\\nNote:  The data type of an arithmetic expression’s value matches the most complex, or widest, \\ndata type among the operands in the expression. In other words, the data type matches the type \\nthat appears rightmost in the following list:\\nbyte → short → int → long → float → double\\nFor example, if sum is float  and more  is int, sum + more  is float .\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='elements of Java   B-1 1\\n B.23  The division operator / deserves special attention, because the type of its operands can affect the \\nvalue produced in a dramatic way. When you combine two numbers with the division operator / \\nand at least one of the numbers has a floating-point type, the result has a floating-point type. For \\nexample, 9.0 / 2 has one operand of type double , namely 9.0. Hence, the result is the type double  \\nnumber 4.5. However, when both operands have an integer type, the result can be surprising. For example \\n9 / 2 has two operands of type int, and so it yields the result 4 of type int, not 4.5. The \\nfraction after the decimal point is simply lost. When you divide two integers, the result is truncated, not rounded. The part after the decimal point is discarded no matter how large it is. So, \\n11 / 3 is 3,  \\nnot 3.6666 . . . . If nothing but a zero is after the decimal point, that decimal point and zero are still lost. Even this seemingly trivial difference can be of some significance. For example, \\n8.0 / 2 has \\nthe value 4.0 of type double , which technically is only an approximate quantity. However, 8 / 2  \\nhas the int value 4, which is an exact quantity. The approximate nature of 4.0 can affect the accu-\\nracy of any further calculation that is performed with this result.\\nOften, the % operator has operands only of integer types. You use it to recover the equiva-\\nlent of the fraction after the decimal point. When you divide one integer by another, you get a result (which some call a quotient) and a remainder. For example, 14 divided by 4 yields 3 with a \\n remainder of 2 (or with 2 left over). The % operation gives the remainder—that is, the amount left \\nover after doing the division. So 14 / 4 is 3 and 14 % 4 is 2, because 14 divided by 4 is 3 with 2 left \\nover. The % operator is called the remainder operator.\\nThe % operator has more applications than you might at first suspect. It allows your program \\nto count by 2s, 3s, or any other number. For example, if you want to do something to every other integer, you need to know whether the integer is even or odd. An integer \\nn is even if n % 2 is zero, \\nand it is odd if n % 2 is not zero. Similarly, if you want your program to do something to every third \\ninteger, you test whether the integer n is divisible by 3. It will be if n % 3 is zero.\\nProgramming Tip:  To make your arithmetic expressions more readable, place a space on \\nboth sides of each binary operator.\\n Parentheses and Precedence Rules\\n B.24  You can use parentheses to group portions of an arithmetic expression in the same way that you use parentheses in algebra and arithmetic. With the aid of parentheses, you can indicate which operations are performed first, second, and so forth. For example, consider the following two expressions that differ only in the positioning of their parentheses:\\n(cost + tax) * discount\\ncost + (tax * discount)\\nTo evaluate the first expression, the application first adds cost  and tax and then multiplies the \\nresult by discount . To evaluate the second expression, it multiplies tax by discount  and then \\nadds the result to cost . If you use some numbers for the values of the variables and carry out the \\ntwo evaluations, you will see that they produce different results.\\nIf you omit parentheses, as in the assignment statement\\ntotal = cost + tax * discount;\\nmultiplication occurs before addition. Thus, the previous statement is equivalent to\\ntotal = cost + (tax * discount);\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

For example, \\nunary operators have a higher precedence than binary operators, and binary operators have a \\nlower precedence than unary operators. Operators of higher precedence execute before operators of lower precedence, unless parentheses override this order. Operators at the same level have the same precedence. When two operators have equal precedence, the operations are performed using the following convention:\\nNote:  Binary operators of equal precedence in an expression are performed in left-to-right order.\\n Increment and Decrement Operators\\n B.25  The increment and decrement operators increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1. The increment operator is written as two plus signs, \\n++. For example, the following Java statement \\nwill increase the value of the variable count  by 1:\\ncount++;\\nIf the variable count  has the value 5 before this statement is executed, it will have the value 6 after \\nthe statement is executed. Thus, this statement is equivalent to\\ncount = count + 1;\\nYou can use the increment operator with variables of any numeric type, but it is used most often with variables of an integer type such as \\nint.\\nThe decrement operator is similar, except that it subtracts 1 rather than adds 1 to the value of \\nthe variable. The decrement operator is written as two minus signs, ––. For example, the following \\nwill decrease the value of the variable count  by 1:\\ncount--;\\nIf the variable count  has the value 5 before this statement is executed, it will have the value 4 after \\nthe statement is executed. This statement is equivalent to\\ncount = count - 1;\\n B.26  You can use the increment and decrement operators within expressions, but when you do, the increment operator or the decrement operator changes the value of the variable it is applied to and returns a value. Although we do not recommend using the increment and decrement operators in expressions, you might see them used this way in code written by other developers.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

For example, consider the code\\nint n = 3;\\nint m = 4;int result = n * (++m);\\nAfter this code executes, the value of n is unchanged at 3, the value of m is 5, and the value of result  \\nis 15. Thus, ++m changes the value of m and returns that changed value to the multiply operator.\\nIn the previous example, we placed the increment operator before the variable m. If we place \\nit after the variable m, something slightly different happens. Consider the code\\nint n = 3;int m = 4;int result = n * (m++);\\nNow, after the code executes, the value of n is 3 and the value of m is 5, just as in the previous \\nexample. However, the value of result  is 12, not 15, because m++ returns the value of m to the \\nmultiply operator and then changes the value of m.\\nThe two expressions n * (++m)  and n * (m++)  both increase the value of m by 1, but the first \\nexpression increases the value of m before it does the multiplication, whereas the second expres-\\nsion increases the value of m after it does the multiplication. Both ++m and m++ have the same \\n effect on the final value of m, but when we use them as part of an arithmetic expression, they give \\na different value to the expression.\\nSimilarly, both ––m and m–– have the same effect on the final value of m, but when we use them \\nas part of an arithmetic expression, they give a different value to the expression. If the –– is before  \\nthe m, the value of m is decreased before its value is used in the expression. If the –– is after the m, \\nthe value of m is decreased after its value is used in the expression.\\nThe increment and decrement operators can be applied only to variables. They cannot be \\n applied to constants or to entire, more complicated arithmetic expressions.\\nProgramming Tip:  To avoid errors and confusing code, use the operator ++ or –– only in a \\nstatement that involves one variable and no other operators.\\n Special Assignment Operators\\n B.27  You can combine the simple assignment operator ( =) with an arithmetic operator, such as +, to \\nproduce a kind of special-purpose assignment operator. For example, the following will increase \\nthe value of the variable amount  by 5:\\namount += 5;\\nThis is really just a shorthand for\\namount = amount + 5;\\nYou can do the same thing with any of the other arithmetic operators –, *, /, and %. For example, \\nthe statement\\namount *= 25\\nis equivalent to\\namount = amount * 25;\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

However, when you see 3.14159, you might not be sure that it is π and not some other number; somebody other than you might have no idea of where the number 3.14159 came from. To avoid such confusion, you should always give a name to constants, such as 3.14159, and use the name instead of writing out the number. For example, we might give the number 3.14159 the name \\nPI. Then the assignment statement\\narea = 3.14159 * radius * radius;\\ncould be written more clearly as\\narea = PI * radius * radius;\\nHow do you give a number, or other constant, a name like PI? You could use a variable named \\nPI and initialize it to the desired value 3.14159. But then you might inadvertently change the value \\nof this variable. However, Java provides a mechanism that allows you to define and initialize a variable and moreover fix the variable’s value so it cannot be changed. The syntax is\\npublic static final type name  = constant;\\nFor example, the statement\\npublic static final double PI = 3.14159;\\ngives the name PI to the constant 3.14159. The part\\ndouble PI = 3.14159;\\nsimply declares PI as a variable and initializes it to 3.14159. The word public  says that there \\nare no restrictions on where we can use the name PI. The word static  defines one copy of PI \\nthat every object of the class can access instead of having its own copy of PI. The word final  \\nmeans that the value 3.14159 is the final value assigned to PI or, to phrase it another way, it \\nmeans that the program cannot change the value of PI. Appendix C provides more details about \\nstatic  and final .\\nIt is a good practice to place named constants near the beginning of a class and outside of any \\nmethod definitions. That way, your named constants are handy in case you need to modify them. You might, for example, want to change the number of digits you provide for a constant.\\nNote:  The class Math  in the Java Class Library defines a static constant named PI just like \\nthe one we defined in this segment, but with more decimal places. The following segment \\ndescribes this class and shows how to access PI. You should use Math ’s PI instead of defining \\nyour own.\\nProgramming Tip:  Programmers typically use all uppercase letters when naming constants \\nto distinguish constants from ordinary variables. They use an underscore as a separator in multi -\\nword names. For example, FEET_PER_MILE  follows this convention.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

These methods are static methods. (Segment C.28 of Appendix C dis-\\ncusses static methods in more detail.) When you invoke a static method, you write the class name—\\nMath , in this case—a dot, the name of the method, and a pair of parentheses. Using the \\nname of a class to invoke a method is not typical. Ordinarily, you use the name of an object to invoke a method.\\nMost \\nMath  methods require that you specify items within the pair of parentheses. As we noted \\nearlier in this appendix, these items are called arguments to the method. Thus, a typical invocation of a method in this class has the form \\nMath. method_name (arguments ).\\nYou can invoke the method in an assignment statement, such as\\nvariable = Math. method_name (arguments );\\nor embed it within an arithmetic expression. That is, you can use Math. method_name (arguments ) \\nanyplace that you can use a variable of a primitive data type. Figure B-2 describes some of the available methods in this class.\\nThe class \\nMath  also has two predefined named constants. E is the base of the natural logarithm \\nsystem—often written e  in mathematical formulas—and is approximately 2.72. PI is used in cal-\\nculations involving circular geometric figures—often written π in mathematical formulas—and is approximately 3.14159. Because these constants are defined in the class \\nMath , you use them by \\nwriting Math.E  and Math.PI .\\nSimple input and Output Using the Keyboard and Screen\\nThe input and output of data is usually referred to as I /O. A Java program can perform I/O in \\nmany different ways. In this section, we present some ways to handle simple text input that we type at the keyboard and simple text output displayed on the screen.\\n Screen Output\\n B.30  Statements like\\nSystem.out.println(\"Enter a whole number from 1 to 99.\");\\nand\\nSystem.out.println(quarters + \" quarters\");\\nsend output to the display screen. As we mentioned earlier in this appendix, System.out  is an \\nobject within the class System , which is a class in the Java Class Library. This object has println  \\nas one of its methods. So the preceding output statements are calls to the method println  of \\nthe object System.out . You simply follow System.out.println  with a pair of parentheses that \\ncontain what you want to display. You end the statement with a semicolon.\\nWithin the parentheses can be strings of text in double quotes, like \"Enter a whole number \\nfrom 1 to 99.\" , variables like quarters , numbers like 5 or 7.3, and almost any other object \\nor value. To display more than one thing, simply place a + operator between them. For example,\\nSystem.out.println(\"Lucky number = \" + 13 +\\n                   \"Secret number = \" + number);\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

If we want a space between the 13 and the word “Secret” \\nin the preceding output—and we probably do—we should add a space to the beginning of the \\nstring \"Secret number = \"  so that it becomes \" Secret number = \" .\\nNotice that you use double quotes, not single quotes, and that the opening and closing quotes \\nare the same symbol.

You also should indent the second line to make the entire statement \\neasier to read.\\nLater, in the section about the class String , you will see that the + operator joins, or \\n concatenates, two strings. In the preceding System.out.println  statement, Java converts the \\nnumber 13 to the string \"13\" . Likewise, it converts the integer 7 in the variable number  to the \\nstring \"7\". Then the + operator joins the strings and the System.out.println  statement displays \\nthe result. You do need to be a bit careful, however.

If you want the output from two or more output \\nstatements to appear on a single line, use print  instead of println . For example,\\nSystem.out.print(\"One, two,\");System.out.print(\" buckle my shoe.\");System.out.println(\" Three, four,\");System.out.println(\"shut the door.\");\\nwill produce the following output:\\nOne, two, buckle my shoe. Three, four,shut the door.\\nNotice that a new line is not started until you use println , rather than print . Also notice that \\nthe new line starts after displaying the items specified in the println  statement. This is the only \\ndifference between print  and println .\\n Keyboard Input Using the Class Scanner\\n B.32  A Java program can read data from either the keyboard or another source such as a disk, and \\nplace it into memory. The Java Class Library provides the class Scanner  for this purpose. Here, \\nwe will use the methods in Scanner  to read data typed at the keyboard and place it into variables \\nthat we specify.\\nAs we noted earlier, the class Scanner  is in the package java.util . To use Scanner  in your \\nprogram, you must import it from this package by writing the following import  statement before \\nthe rest of your program:\\nimport java.util.Scanner;\\nBefore you can use any of the methods in Scanner , you must create a Scanner  object by writ-\\ning a statement such as\\nScanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);\\nThe variable keyboard —which could be any variable of your choosing—is assigned a Scanner  \\nobject that is associated with the input device that System.in  represents. This device by conven-\\ntion is the keyboard. The variable keyboard  has a class type.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='B-18  Appendix B   Java Basics\\n B.33  Scanner  provides several methods that read input data. You can use any of these methods by \\n writing a statement that has the following form, where keyboard  is the Scanner  object that we \\ndefined previously:\\nvariable = keyboard. method_name ();\\nThe named method reads a value from the keyboard and returns it. That is, the expression \\nkeyboard. method_name () represents the value that was read. The previous statement then \\n assigns this value to the indicated variable.\\nYou can read integers and real numbers by using the following expressions:\\nkeyboard.nextInt() — Returns the next integer encountered in the input data.\\nkeyboard.nextDouble() — Returns the next real number encountered in the input data.\\nEach of these expressions ignores any white space that might precede or follow the number typed \\nat the keyboard. White-space characters are the characters that appear as spaces when printed on paper or displayed on the screen. The blank-space character is likely the only white-space charac -\\nter that will concern us at first, but the start of a new line and the tab symbol are also white-space characters.\\n B.34  Example. To read an integer from the keyboard, you can write a statement such as\\nsize = keyboard.nextInt();\\nwhere size  has been declared previously as an int variable. The user of your program would type \\nan integer and press the Enter, or Return, key. The value is read by the method nextInt , returned, \\nand assigned to the variable size .\\nTypically, you should display a message, or prompt, for the user to enter data. For example, \\nyour program might contain the following statements:\\nSystem.out.println(\"What is your age?\");\\nint age = keyboard.nextInt();\\nWhatever the user types appears in the same window as the prompt. Here, the prompt would  appear \\non one line and the user would type his or her age on the next.\\n B.35  Example. To read a real number from the keyboard, you can write statements such as\\nSystem.out.print(\"Enter the area of your room in square feet: \");double area = keyboard.nextDouble();\\nAfter the user types a real number at the keyboard and presses the Enter key, the value of the \\nnumber is assigned to the variable area . Since we have used print  instead of println , both the \\nprompt and the input data appear on the same line on the display.\\n B.36  Example. You can read more than one value per line of input. For example,\\nSystem.out.println(\"Please enter your height in feet and inches:\");\\nint feet = keyboard.nextInt();int inches = keyboard.nextInt();\\nThe user could type either\\n6 2\\non one line or\\n62\\non two lines. In either case, feet  is 6 and inches  is 2.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

The name of the input stream associated with the keyboard is \\nSystem.in . Likewise, an output stream is an object that directs data \\nfrom your program to an output device. System.out  is such an object, directing characters to \\na display.\\n B.37  More input methods. The class Scanner  includes the following method to read a string:\\nnextLine() — Returns the string that appears next in the input data.\\nFor example, if keyboard  is defined as shown earlier, the statement\\nString message = keyboard.nextLine();\\nreads the entire string that the user types before pressing the Enter key—including any spaces—\\nand assigns it to the variable message .\\nThe method next  in the class Scanner  reads the next group of contiguous characters that are \\nnot white space and returns it as a string. For example, you can use this method to read the next word that appears in the input data, as follows:\\nString word = keyboard.next();\\nWe used next  in Segment B.3 to read the user’s yes or no response.\\nThe Scanner  methods we’ve looked at— nextInt , nextDouble , nextLine , and next —often \\nare invoked in simple assignment statements, although that is not necessary. Since each method returns a value, you can call it within an arithmetic expression, for example.\\nThe if-else  Statement\\n B.38  In programs, as in everyday life, things can sometimes go in one of two different ways. If you have money in your checking account, some banks will pay you a little interest. On the other hand, if you have overdrawn your checking account, you will be charged a penalty. This might be reflected in the bank’s accounting program by the following Java statement, known as an \\nif-else  statement:\\nif (balance >= 0)\\n   balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;else   balance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;\\nThe two-symbol operator >= means “greater than or equal to” in Java. We use two symbols because \\nthe one-character symbol ≥  is not on the keyboard.\\nThe meaning of an if-else  statement is really just the meaning it would have if read as an \\nEnglish sentence. When your program executes an if-else  statement, it first checks the expres-\\nsion in parentheses after the if. This expression must evaluate to either true or false. If it is true, \\nthe statement after the if is executed. If the expression is false, the statement after the else  is \\nexecuted. In the preceding example, if balance  is positive or zero, the following action occurs:\\nbalance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 19}, page_content='B-20  Appendix B   Java Basics\\n(We divide by 12 because the interest is for only 1 of 12 months.) On the other hand, if the value \\nof balance  is negative, the following is executed instead:\\nbalance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;\\nThe indentation in the if-else  statement is conventional as an aid in reading the statement; it does \\nnot affect the statement’s meaning.\\n B.39  If you want to include more than one statement in either of the two portions of the if-else  state-\\nment, you simply enclose the statements in braces, as in the following example:\\nif (balance >= 0)\\n{   System.out.println(\"Good for you. You earned interest.\");   balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;}else{   System.out.println(\"You will be charged a penalty.\");   balance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;} // end if\\nWhen you enclose several statements within braces, you get one larger statement called a \\n compound statement. Compound statements are seldom used by themselves but often are used \\nas substatements of a larger statement such as an if-else  statement.\\nProgramming Tip:  Some programmers always use compound statements within other \\nstatements such as if-else , even when only a single statement appears between the braces. \\nDoing so makes it easier to add another statement to the compound statement, but more \\n importantly, it avoids the error that would occur if you forgot to add the braces. We encourage \\nyou to follow this convention, even though we do not always do so in this book to save space.\\n B.40  You can omit the else  part. If you do, nothing happens when the tested expression is false. For \\nexample, if your bank does not charge an overdraft penalty, the statement would be the following, \\ninstead of the previous one:\\nif (balance >= 0)\\n{   System.out.println(\"Good for you. You earned interest.\");   balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;} // end if\\nIf balance  is negative, the statement after the closing brace executes next.\\n Boolean Expressions\\n B.41  A boolean expression is an expression that is either true or false. The expression\\nbalance >= 0\\nthat we used in the previous if-else  statement is an example of a simple boolean expression. Such \\nexpressions compare two things, like numbers, variables, or other expressions. Figure B-3 shows \\nthe various Java comparison operators you can use to compare two expressions.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 20}, page_content='B.42  Logical operators. Often, when you write an if-else  statement, you will want to use a boolean \\nexpression that is more complicated than a simple comparison. You can form more-complicated \\nboolean expressions from simpler ones by joining expressions with either the Java version of “and,” which is \\n&&, or the Java version of “or,” which is ||. For example, consider the following:\\nif ((pressure > min) && (pressure < max))\\n    System.out.println(\"Pressure is OK.\");\\nelse   \\n System.out.println(\"Warning: Pressure is out of range.\");\\nIf the value of pressure  is greater than min, and the value of pressure  is less than max, the output \\nwill be\\nPressure is OK.\\nOtherwise, the output is\\nWarning: Pressure is out of range.\\nNote that you cannot use a string of inequalities in Java, like the following:\\nmin < pressure < max  Illegal!\\nInstead, you must express each inequality separately and connect them with &&, as follows:\\n(pressure > min) && (pressure < max)\\nThe parentheses in the previous expression are not necessary, but we typically include them. The \\nparentheses that surround the entire expression in an if-else  statement are required, however.\\nThe binary operators && and || together with the unary operator ! are logical operators. We \\nlook at each of them next.\\n B.43  The operator &&. When you form a larger boolean expression by connecting two smaller expres-\\nsions with &&, the entire larger expression is true provided that both of the smaller expressions \\nare true. Thus, if at least one of pressure > min  and pressure < max  is false, the larger expres-\\nsion is false. Moreover, if the first part of the larger expression is false, the second part is ignored, since the larger expression must be false regardless of the value of the second part. For example, if \\npressure  is less than min, we know that\\n(pressure > min) && (pressure < max)\\nis false without looking at pressure < max ./H11350 Greater than or equal to /H11022/H11005 points /H11022/H11005 60\\n/H11349  Less than or equal to /H11021/H11005 expenses /H11021/H11005 income\\n/H11022 Greater than /H11022 expenses /H11022 income\\n/H11021  Less than /H11021 pressure /H11021 max\\n/H11005 Equal to  /H11005/H11005 balance /H11005/H11005 0\\n   answer /H11005/H11005 \\'y\\'\\n/HS11005 Not equal to !/H11005 income !/H11005 tax \\n   answer !/H11005 \\'y\\'Math\\nNotationName Java\\nOperatorJava ExamplesFiGUR e B-3  Java comparison operatorsThe if-else  Statement   B-21\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

You also can use || to form a larger boolean expression from smaller ones in \\nthe same way that you use &&, but with different results. The meaning is essentially the same as \\nthe English word “or.” For example, consider\\nif ((salary > expenses) || (salary + savings > expenses))\\n   System.out.println(\"Solvent\");else   System.out.println(\"Bankrupt\");\\nIf the value of salary  is greater than the value of expenses  or the value of salary + savings  is \\ngreater than the value of expenses —or both—the output will be\\nSolvent\\nOtherwise, the output will be\\nBankrupt\\nThe entire larger expression is true if either of the smaller expressions is true. Moreover, if \\nthe first part of the larger expression is true, the second part is ignored, since the larger expression \\nmust be true regardless of the value of the second part. For example, if salary  is greater than \\nexpenses , we know that\\n(salary > expenses) || (salary + savings > expenses)\\nis true without looking at salary + savings > expenses .\\nYou use parentheses in expressions containing the || operator in the same way that you use \\nthem with &&.\\nNote:  Short-circuit evaluation\\nWhen two boolean expressions are joined by either && or ||, the second expression is not evalu-\\nated if the value of the first expression implies the value of the entire expression. Such is the  \\ncase if the first expression is false when the operator is && or true when the operator is ||. This \\nbehavior is known as the short-circuit evaluation of a boolean expression.\\nBesides saving execution time, short-circuit evaluation can prevent execution errors. For \\nexample, the following statement prevents a division by zero:\\nif ((count != 0) && (sum / count > minimum))\\nIf count  is zero, the expression count != 0  is false. Thus, the expression sum / count > minimum  \\nis not evaluated, thereby avoiding the erroneous division.\\n B.45  The operator !. You can negate a boolean expression by preceding it with the operator !. For \\nexample, the expression\\n!(number >= min)\\nhas the same meaning as the expression\\nnumber < min\\nIn this case, you can and should avoid using !.\\nSometimes, however, the use of ! makes perfect sense. For example, if you have two strings \\nthat should be the same for normal processing to continue, you would compare them and issue a warning if they are not equal.

These smaller statements \\ncan be any sort of Java statements. In particular, you can use one if-else  statement within another \\nif-else  statement to get nested if-else  statements, as illustrated by the following:\\nif (balance >= 0)   if (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)      balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;   else      System.out.println(\"Cannot have a negative interest.\");else   balance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;\\nIf the value of balance  is greater than or equal to zero, the entire following if-else  statement is \\nexecuted:\\nif (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)   balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;else   System.out.println(\"Cannot have a negative interest.\");\\nWhen writing nested if-else  statements, you may sometimes become confused about which \\nif goes with which else . To eliminate this confusion, you can add braces as follows:\\nif (balance >= 0){   if (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)      balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;   else      System.out.println(\"Cannot have a negative interest.\");}else   balance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;\\nHere, the braces are an aid to clarity but are not, strictly speaking, needed. In other cases, they are \\nneeded.

The following two if-else  statements differ only in \\nthat one has a pair of braces, but they do not have the same meaning:\\n// First Version\\nif (balance >= 0){   if (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)      balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;}else   balance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;\\n// Second Version\\nif (balance >= 0)   if (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)      balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;else   balance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;\\nIn the second version, without braces, the else  is paired with the second if, not the first one, as \\nthe indentation leads us to believe. Thus, the meaning is\\n// Equivalent to Second Versionif (balance >= 0){   if (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)      balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;   else      balance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;}\\nTo clarify the difference a bit more, consider what happens when balance  is less than zero. \\nThe first version causes the following action:\\nbalance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;\\nHowever, the second version takes no action.\\nNote:  In an if-else  statement, each else  is paired with the nearest previous unmatched if.\\nProgramming Tip:  Indentation within an if-else  statement does not affect the action of \\nthe statement. For clarity, you should use indentation that matches the logic of the statement.\\n Multiway if-else  Statements\\n B.48  Since an if-else  statement has two outcomes, and each of these two outcomes can have an \\n if-else  statement with two outcomes, you can use nested if-else  statements to produce any \\nnumber of possible effects. Convention provides a standard way of doing this. Let’s start with an \\nexample.\\nSuppose balance  is a variable that holds your checking account balance and you want to \\nknow whether your balance is positive, negative (overdrawn), or zero. To avoid any questions \\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

To find out if your balance  is positive, negative, or zero, \\nyou could use the following nested if-else  statement:\\nif (balance > 0)\\n   System.out.println(\"Positive balance\");else if (balance < 0)   System.out.println(\"Negative balance\");else if (balance == 0)   System.out.println(\"Zero balance\");\\nThis is really an ordinary nested if-else  statement, but it is indented differently than before. The \\nindentation reflects the logic more clearly and is preferred. Although this is not a separate kind of \\nif-else  statement, we call this nested construction a multiway if-else  statement.\\nWhen a multiway if-else  statement is executed, the application tests the boolean expres-\\nsions one after the other, starting from the top. When it finds the first true boolean expression, \\nit executes the statement after the expression. The rest of the if-else  statement is ignored. For \\nexample, if balance  is greater than zero, the preceding statements will display\\nPositive balance\\nExactly one of the three possible messages will be displayed, depending on the value of the vari-able \\nbalance .\\n B.49  The previous example has three possibilities, but you can have any number of possibilities by add-ing more \\nelse-if  parts. In this example, the possibilities are mutually exclusive. That is, only \\none of the three possibilities can actually occur for any given value of balance . However, you can \\nuse any boolean expressions, even if they are not mutually exclusive. If more than one boolean expression is true, only the action associated with the first true boolean expression is executed. A multiway \\nif-else  statement never performs more than one action.\\nIf none of the boolean expressions is true, nothing happens. However, it is a good practice \\nto add an else  clause—without any if—at the end, to be executed in case none of the boolean \\nexpressions is true. In fact, we can rewrite our previous example in this way. We know that if \\nbalance  is neither positive nor negative, it must be zero. So we do not need the test\\nif (balance == 0)\\nThus, we can and should write the previous if-else  statement as\\nif (balance > 0)\\n   System.out.println(\"Positive balance\");else if (balance < 0)   System.out.println(\"Negative balance\");else   System.out.println(\"Zero balance\");\\n The Conditional Operator (Optional)\\n B.50  To allow compatibility with older programming styles, Java includes an operator that is a nota -\\ntional variant on certain forms of the if-else  statement. A conditional operator expression  \\nconsists of a boolean expression followed by a question mark and two expressions separated by a \\ncolon. For example, the expression on the right side of the assignment operator in the following statement is a conditional operator expression:\\nmax = (n1 > n2) ? n1 : n2;\\nThe ? and : together form a ternary operator that has three operands and is known as the \\n conditional operator. If the boolean expression is true, the value of the first of the two  expressions \\nis returned; otherwise, the value of the second of the two expression is returned. Thus, the logic of this example is equivalent toThe if-else  Statement   B-25\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

If you decide to use them in your program, realize that not everyone will \\nknow their meaning.\\nThe switch  Statement\\n B.51  Multiway if-else  statements can become unwieldy when you must choose from among many \\npossible courses of action. If the choice is based on the value of an integer or character expression, \\nthe switch  statement can make your code easier to read.\\nThe switch  statement begins with the word switch  followed by an expression in parentheses. \\nThis expression is called the controlling expression. Its value must be of type int, char , byte , \\nshort , or String . The switch  statement in the following example determines the price of a ticket \\naccording to the location of the seat in a theater. An integer code that indicates the seat location is the controlling expression:\\nint seatLocationCode;\\n< Code here assigns a value to  seatLocationCode  >\\n. . .\\ndouble price = −0.01;switch (seatLocationCode){\\n   case 1:\\n      System.out.println(\"Balcony.\");      price = 15.00;      break;   case 2:      System.out.println(\"Mezzanine.\");      price = 30.00;      break;   case 3:      System.out.println(\"Orchestra.\");      price = 40.00;      break;   default:      System.out.println(\"Unknown ticket code.\");      break;} // end switch\\nThe switch  statement contains a list of cases, each consisting of the reserved word case , a \\nconstant, a colon, and a list of statements that are the actions for the case. The constant after the \\nword case  is called a case label. When the switch  statement executes, the controlling expres-\\nsion—in this example, seatLocationCode —is evaluated. The list of alternative cases is searched \\nuntil a case label that matches the current value of the controlling expression is found. Then the action associated with that label is executed. You are not allowed to have duplicate case labels, as that would be ambiguous.\\nIf no match is found, the case labeled \\ndefault  is executed. The default  case is optional. \\nIf there is no default  case, and no match is found to any of the cases, no action takes place. \\n Although the default  case is optional, we encourage you to always use it. If you think your cases \\ncover all the possibilities without a default  case, you can insert an error message or an assertion \\nas the default  case. You never know when you might have missed some obscure case.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

If \\nyou omit the break  statement, the action just continues with the statements in the next case until \\nit reaches either a break  statement or the end of the switch  statement. Sometimes this feature is \\ndesirable, but sometimes omitting the break  statement causes unwanted results.\\nNote:  The controlling expression in a switch  statement provides an entry point to a case \\nwithin the statement. Execution continues from this point until it reaches either a break  state-\\nment or the end of the switch .\\n B.52  At times, you will want to take the same action in more than one case. You can list cases one after \\nthe other so that they all apply to the same action. In the following example, we have changed the seat location code to a character instead of an integer. A code of B  or b , for example, indicates a \\nbalcony seat:\\nchar seatLocationCode;\\n< Code here assigns a value to seatLocationCode  >\\n. . .\\ndouble price = −0.01;switch (seatLocationCode){\\n   case \\'B\\':\\n   case \\'b\\':      System.out.println(\"Balcony.\");      price = 15.00;      break;   case \\'M\\': case \\'m\\':      System.out.println(\"Mezzanine.\");      price = 30.00;      break;   case \\'O\\': case \\'o\\':      System.out.println(\"Orchestra.\");      price = 40.00;      break;   default:      System.out.println(\"Unknown ticket code.\");      break;} // end switch\\nThe first case, B, has no break  statement; in fact, the case has no action statements at all. Execu-\\ntion continues with the case for b , as desired. Note that we have written the cases in two ways to \\nshow two common programming styles.\\nThe controlling expression in a switch  statement need not be a single variable. It can be a more \\ncomplicated expression, but it must evaluate to a single value. The expression cannot indicate a \\nrange of values. That is, the expression cannot be a boolean expression like the ones you use in an \\nif-else  statement. Thus, if you want to take one action when the controlling expression has values \\nfrom 1 to 10 and a second action for values from 11 to 20, you would need a case label for each value. In situations like this, a \\nswitch  statement would be harder to write than an if-else  statement.\\nProgramming Tip:  Omitting a break  statement\\nIf you test a program that contains a switch  statement and it executes two cases when you \\nexpect it to execute only one case, you probably have forgotten to include a break  statement \\nwhere one is needed.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

You should also take care that the possible strings assigned to \\nseatLocationCode  match the case labels exactly. In this example, the labels use lowercase letters. \\nTo ensure that the value of the controlling expression uses lowercase letters, we can replace the \\nbeginning of the switch  statement with\\nswitch (seatLocationCode.toLowercase())\\nSegment B.76 later in this appendix will describe the String  method toLowercase  further.\\nenumerations\\n B.54  To compute a student’s quality-point average—also known as a grade-point average—a pro-gram could assign the number of quality points for a given letter grade to the \\ndouble  variable \\nqualityPoints . You could use a char  variable grade  for the letter grade, but then it could contain \\nany character, not just the letters A , B, C, D, and F . Instead, to restrict the contents of grade  to \\nthe values you specify, you could declare it as an enumerated data type, or enumeration. An enumeration itemizes the values that a variable can have.\\nFor example, the following statement defines \\nLetterGrade  as an enumeration:\\nenum LetterGrade {A, B, C, D, F}\\nLetterGrade  behaves as a class type, so we can declare grade  to have this type, as follows:\\nLetterGrade grade;\\nThe items listed between the braces in the definition of LetterGrade  are objects that grade  can \\nreference. These values behave as static constants. For example, you can write\\ngrade = LetterGrade.A;\\nto assign A to grade . You qualify each of them with the name of the enumeration just as you \\nqualify the constant PI with the name of its class Math . Assigning a value other than A, B, C, D, or \\nF to grade  will cause a syntax error.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

Therefore, you cannot define an enumeration within \\na method. Instead, define enumerations outside of any method definitions, preferably near the  \\nbeginning of your class. Also, note that no semicolon follows an enumeration’s definition. \\n Writing one, however, will not cause a syntax error; the semicolon will simply be ignored.\\n B.55  Example. You can use a switch  statement with a variable whose data type is an enumeration. For \\nexample, if we define LetterGrade  and grade  as in the previous segment, the following switch  \\nstatement assigns the correct number of quality points to the double  variable qualityPoints :\\nswitch (grade)\\n{   case A:      qualityPoints = 4.0;      break;   case B:      qualityPoints = 3.0;      break;   case C:      qualityPoints = 2.0;      break;   case D:      qualityPoints = 1.0;      break;   case F:      qualityPoints = 0.0;      break;   default:      qualityPoints = -9.0;} // end switch\\nSince the data type of the expression in the switch  statement is an enumeration, the case l  abels are \\nassumed to belong to that enumeration without qualification. In fact, writing\\ncase LetterGrade.A: // Syntax error\\nfor example, is a syntax error. However, if you need to reference one of the enumerated values \\nelsewhere within the switch  statement, you must qualify it.\\nSince we know that grade  cannot have values other than those in the enumeration, a default \\ncase is unnecessary. However, if you choose to omit the default case, you must assign a value to \\nqualityPoints  prior to the switch  statement to avoid a syntax error. Without this initialization, \\nthe compiler would think it possible for qualityPoints  to remain uninitialized after the switch  \\nstatement.\\n B.56  When the compiler encounters an enumeration, it creates a class that has several methods. Among them is the method \\nordinal , which you can use to access the ordinal value of an object within an \\nenumeration. These values begin at zero. Thus, in LetterGrade , the ordinal values of A and F are \\n0 and 4, respectively. For example, if you have the following assignment:\\nLetterGrade yourGrade = LetterGrade.A;\\nthe expression\\nyourGrade.ordinal()\\nreturns 0.

For example, the expression\\nLetterGrade.valueOf(\"A\")\\nreturns LetterGrade.A . The string passed to valueOf  must match the name of the constant exactly.\\nAppendix C discusses enumerations further, beginning at Segment C.30.\\nScope\\n B.57  The scope of a variable (or a named constant) is the portion of a program in which the variable \\nis available. That is, a variable does not exist outside of its scope. A variable’s scope begins at its \\ndeclaration and ends at the closing brace of the pair of braces that enclose the variable’s declara-tion.\\nFor example, consider the following statements that involve two variables, \\ncounter  and \\n greeting :\\n{\\n   // counter and greeting are not available here   . . .   int counter = 1;   // counter is available here   . . .   {      String greeting = \"Hello!\";      // Both greeting and counter are available here      . . .   } // end scope of greeting   . . .   // Only counter is available here   . . .} // end scope of counter\\nThe variable counter  is available anywhere after its declaration. The variable greeting  is avail-\\nable only within the inner pair of braces.\\nThe concept of scope applies to every pair of braces within a Java program, regardless of \\nwhether they delineate the definition of a class or a method, appear within an if-else  statement \\nor switch  statement, or appear within the loops described in the next section.\\nLoops\\n B.58  Programs often need to repeat some action. For example, a grading program would contain some \\ncode that assigns a letter grade to a student based on the student’s scores on assignments and exams. To assign grades to the entire class, the program would repeat this action for each student in the class. A portion of a program that repeats a statement or group of statements is called a loop. \\nThe statement (or group of statements) to be repeated in a loop is called the body of the loop. Each repetition of the loop body is called an iteration of the loop.\\nWhen you design a loop, you need to decide what action the body of the loop should take and \\nwhen the loop should stop repeating this action. Once you have made these choices, you can pick one of three Java statements to implement the loop: the \\nwhile  statement, the for statement, or the \\ndo-while  statement.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

A while  statement repeats its action again and again until a controlling boolean expression \\nbecomes false. That is, the loop is repeated while the controlling boolean expression is true. The \\ngeneral form of a while  statement is\\nwhile ( expression )\\n   statement ;\\nThe while  loop starts with the reserved word while  followed by a boolean expression in \\nparentheses. The loop body is a statement, typically a compound statement enclosed in braces \\n{}. The loop body is repeated while the boolean expression is true. The loop body normally \\ncontains some action that can change the value of the boolean expression from true to false and so end the loop.\\nFor example, the following \\nwhile  statement displays the integers from 1 to a given integer \\nnumber :\\nint number;\\n. . . // Assign a value to number hereint count = 1;while (count <= number){   System.out.println(count);   count++;} // end while\\nLet’s suppose that number  is 2. Since the variable count  begins at 1, the boolean expression  \\ncount <= number  is true at this point, and so the body of the loop executes. Thus, 1 is displayed and \\nthen count  becomes 2. The expression count  <= number  is still true, so the loop’s body executes a \\nsecond time, displaying 2 and incrementing count  to 3. Now count  <= number  is false, so the while  \\nloop ends. Execution continues with the statement, if any, that follows the loop.\\nNotice that if number  is zero or negative in the previous example, nothing is displayed. The \\nbody of the loop would not execute at all, since count , which is 1, would be greater than number .\\nProgramming Tip:  A while  loop can perform zero iterations\\nThe body of a while  loop can execute zero times. When a while  loop executes, its first action is \\nto check the value of the boolean expression. If the boolean expression is false, the loop body is not executed even one time. Perhaps the loop adds up the sum of all your expenses for the day. If you did not go shopping on a given day, you do not want the loop body to execute at all.\\n B.60  Infinite\\tloops. A common program bug is a loop that does not end but simply repeats its loop body \\nagain and again. A loop that iterates its body repeatedly without ever ending is called an infinite \\t\\nloop. Normally, a statement in the body of the loop will change some variables so that the control -\\nling boolean expression becomes false. If this variable does not change in the right way, you can \\nget an infinite loop.\\nFor instance, let’s consider a slight variation to the previous example of a while  loop. If we \\nforget to increment count , the boolean expression will never change and the loop will be infinite:\\nint count = 1;\\nwhile (count <= number){   System.out.println(count);} // end while\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

However, some infinite loops will run forever if left alone. To \\nend a program that is in an infinite loop, you should learn how to force a program to stop running. The way to do this depends on your particular operating system. For example, in a Unix operating system, you would press the key combination Control-C.\\nSometimes a programmer might intentionally write an infinite loop. For example, an ATM \\nmachine would typically be controlled by a program with an infinite loop that handles deposits and withdrawals indefinitely.

The for statement has the following general form:\\nfor ( initialize; test; update)\\n   statement ;\\nHere initialize is an optional assignment of a value to a variable, test is a boolean expression, and \\nupdate is an optional assignment that can change the value of test.\\nFor example, the following for statement is exactly equivalent to the while  statement in \\n Segment B.59:\\nint count, number;\\n. . . // Assign a value to number herefor (count = 1; count <= number; count++)   System.out.println(count);\\nThe first of the three expressions in parentheses, count  = 1, initializes the counter before the \\nloop body is executed for the first time. The second expression, count  <= number , is a boolean \\nexpression that determines whether the loop should continue execution. This boolean expression \\nis tested immediately after the first expression executes and again after each execution of the third expression. The third expression, \\ncount++ , executes after each iteration of the loop body. Thus, \\nthe loop body is executed while count  <= number  is true.\\nIn the previous example, we declared count  before the for statement. After the loop  completes \\nits execution, count  is still available as a variable. We could instead declare count  within the for \\nstatement, as follows:\\nint number;\\n. . . // Assign a value to number herefor (int count = 1; count <= number; count++)   System.out.println(count);\\nIn this case, count  is defined only within the for loop and is not available after the loop completes \\nits execution.\\nProgramming Tip:  Although declaring a variable within a for statement is convenient, \\nrealize that the variable’s scope is then the for loop. The variable is not available after the loop \\ncompletes its execution.\\nThe counter in a for statement is not restricted to an integer type. It can have any primitive \\ntype. You can omit any of the expressions initialize, test, and update from a for statement, but you \\ncannot omit their semicolons. Sometimes it is more convenient to write the initialize part before \\nthe for statement or to place the update part within the body of the loop. This is especially true \\nwhen these parts are lengthy. Although you technically can omit the test from a for loop, you will \\nget an infinite loop if you do.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 32}, page_content='Loops   B-33\\nSome Java programmers tend to favor the for statement over the while  statement because \\nin the for statement the initialization, testing, and incrementing of the counter all appear at the \\nbeginning of the loop. This tendency is especially true for loops that simply count. For more \\n complex logic, a while  loop is often more appropriate.\\nNote:  A for statement is basically another notation for a kind of while  loop. Thus, like a \\nwhile  loop, a for statement might not execute its loop body at all.\\n B.62  The comma in for statements. A for loop can perform more than one initialization. To use a list \\nof initialization actions, separate the actions with commas, as in the following example:\\nint n, product;\\nfor (n = 1, product = 1; n <= 10; n++)   product = product * n;\\nThis for loop initializes n to 1 and product  to 1. Note that you use a comma, not a semicolon, to \\nseparate the initialization actions.\\nYou can have multiple update actions that are separated by commas. This can sometimes lead \\nto a situation in which the for statement has an empty body and still does something useful. For \\nexample, we can rewrite the previous for statement in the following equivalent way:\\nfor (n = 1, product = 1; n <= 10; product = product * n, n++);\\nIn effect, we have made the loop body part of the update action. Notice the semicolon at the end of \\nthe statement. Since a semicolon at the end of a for statement is often the result of a programming \\nerror, a clearer way to write this loop makes the empty body explicit:\\nfor (n = 1, product = 1; n <= 10; product = product * n, n++)\\n{} // end for\\nHowever, the most readable style uses the update action only for variables that control the loop, \\nas in the original version of this for loop.\\nFinally, you cannot have multiple boolean expressions to test for ending a for loop. However, \\nyou can string together multiple tests by using the && and || operators to form one larger boolean \\nexpression.\\nProgramming Tip:  If you have used other programming languages that have a \\n general-purpose comma operator, be warned that the comma operator in Java can appear  \\nonly in for statements.\\n B.63  Using an enumeration with a for statement. The for statement has another form when you \\nwant to repeat statements for each object in an enumeration. For example, if you define\\nenum Suit {CLUBS, DIAMONDS, HEARTS, SPADES}\\nthe for loop\\nfor (Suit nextSuit : Suit.values())   System.out.println(nextSuit);\\ndisplays\\nCLUBSDIAMONDSHEARTSSPADES\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 33}, page_content='B-34  Appendix B   Java Basics\\nYou declare a variable to the left of a colon in the for statement. To the right of the colon, \\nyou represent the values that the variable will have. For the enumeration Suit , the expression \\nSuit.values()  represents the four possible values CLUBS , DIAMONDS , HEARTS , and SPADES . As \\nthe loop executes, nextSuit  takes on each of these values.\\nThis kind of loop—called a for-each loop—can be used with other collections of data, as you \\nwill see.\\n The do-while  Statement\\n B.64  The do-while  statement, or do-while  loop, is similar to the while  statement, but the body of a \\ndo-while  statement always executes at least once. As you saw earlier, the body of a while  loop \\nmight not execute at all.\\nThe general form of a do-while  statement is\\ndo\\n   statement ;\\nwhile ( expression );\\nThe do-while  loop starts with the reserved word do. The loop body is a statement, typically a \\ncompound statement enclosed in braces {}. The loop ends with the reserved word while  followed \\nby a boolean expression in parentheses and a semicolon.\\nProgramming Tip:  Be sure to include a semicolon at the end of a do-while  statement.\\nThe loop body executes and is repeated while the boolean expression is true. The loop body \\nnormally contains some action that can change the value of the boolean expression from true to \\nfalse and so end the loop. The boolean expression is tested at the end of the loop, not at its begin -\\nning, as it is in a while  statement. Thus, the loop body executes at least once even if the boolean \\nexpression starts out false.\\nThe following do-while  statement displays the integers from 1 to a given integer number :\\nint number;\\n. . . // Assign a value to number hereint count = 1;do{   System.out.println(count);   count++;} while (count <= number);\\nAgain, let’s suppose that number  is 2. The variable count  begins at 1 and is displayed. Next, \\ncount  is incremented to 2. Since the expression count  <= number  is true at this point, the body \\nof the loop executes again. The value of count  (2) is displayed, and then count  becomes 3. The \\nexpression count  <= number  is now false, so the do-while  loop ends. Execution continues with the \\nstatement that follows the loop.\\nIf number  is zero or negative in the previous example, 1 is displayed, since the body of the \\nloop executes at least once. If number  can possibly be zero or negative, we should use either a \\nwhile  loop or a for loop here instead of a do-while  loop.\\nNotice that we placed the ending brace and the while  on the same line. Some programmers \\nprefer to place them on different lines. Either form is fine, but be consistent.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 34}, page_content='Loops   B-35\\nTo better understand a do-while  loop, let’s rewrite the previous example in the following way:\\nint number;\\n. . . // Assign a value to number hereint count = 1;{   System.out.println(count);   count++;}while (count <= number){   System.out.println(count);   count++;}\\nWhen you compare the two versions, it is obvious that a do-while  loop differs from a while  loop \\nin only one detail. With a do-while  loop, the loop body is always executed at least once. With a \\nwhile  loop, the loop body might not execute at all.\\n Additional Loop Information\\n B.65  Choosing a loop statement. Suppose you decide that your program needs a loop. How do you \\ndecide whether to use a while  statement, a for statement, or a do-while  statement? You cannot use \\na  do-while  statement unless you are certain that the loop body should execute at least one time. If \\nyou are certain of this, a do-while  statement is likely to be a good choice. However, more often than \\nyou might think, a loop requires the possibility that the body will not execute at all. In those cases, you must use either a \\nwhile  statement or a for statement. If it is a computation that changes some \\nnumeric quantity by some equal amount on each iteration, consider a for statement. If the for state-\\nment does not work well, use a while  statement. The while  statement is always a safe choice, since \\nyou can use it for any sort of loop. But sometimes one of the other alternatives is easier or clearer.\\nProgramming Tip:  A while  loop can do anything that another loop can do.\\n B.66  The break  and continue  statements in loops. You can use the break  statement in a switch  state-\\nment or in any kind of loop statement. When the break  statement executes in a loop, the immediately \\nenclosing loop ends, and the remainder of the loop body is not executed. Execution continues with the statement after the loop.\\nAdding a \\nbreak  statement to a loop can make the loop more difficult to understand. Without \\na break  statement, a loop has a simple, easy-to-understand structure. There is a test for ending \\nthe loop at the top (or bottom) of the loop, and every iteration will go to the end of the loop body. When you add a \\nbreak  statement, the loop might end because either the condition given at the top \\n(or bottom) of the loop is false or the break  statement has executed. Some loop iterations may go \\nto the end of the loop body, but one loop iteration might end prematurely. Because of the compli-cations they introduce, you should avoid \\nbreak  statements in loops. Some authorities contend that \\na break  statement should never be used to end a loop, but virtually all programming authorities \\nagree that they should be used at most sparingly.\\nThe continue  statement ends the current iteration of a loop. The loop continues with the \\nnext iteration. Using a continue  statement in this way has the same problems as using a break  \\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

However, replacing an empty loop body with a continue  statement is acceptable. For \\nexample, you can revise the loop at the end of Segment B.62, as follows:\\nfor (n = 1, product = 1; n <= 10; product = product * n, n++)\\n   continue;\\nProgramming Tip:  In general, do not use break  or continue  statements within the body \\nof a loop.\\nThe Class String\\n B.67  Strings of characters, such as \"Enter the amount:\" , do not have a primitive type in Java. How-\\never, Java does provide a class, called String , that you use to create and process strings of char -\\nacters. The string constant \"Enter the amount:\" , in fact, is a value of type String . The class \\nString  is part of the package java.lang  in the Java Class Library.\\nA variable of type String  can name one of these string values. The statement\\nString greeting;\\ndeclares greeting  to be the name of a String  variable, and the following statement sets the value \\nof greeting  to the String  value \"Hello!\" :\\ngreeting = \"Hello!\";\\nThese two statements are often combined into one, as follows:\\nString greeting = \"Hello!\";\\nWe now can display greeting  on the screen by writing\\nSystem.out.println(greeting);\\nThe screen will show\\nHello!\\n Characters Within Strings\\n B.68  Most programming languages use the ASCII character set, which assigns a standard number to \\neach of the characters normally used on an English-language keyboard. Java, however, uses the Unicode character set instead. The Unicode character set includes all the ASCII characters plus many of the characters used in languages that have an alphabet different from English. As it turns out, this is not likely to be a big issue if you are using an English-language keyboard. Normally, you can just program as if Java were using the ASCII character set, since the codes for the ASCII characters are the same in Unicode. The advantage of the Unicode character set is that it allows you to easily handle languages other than English. The disadvantage of the Unicode character set is that it requires two bytes to store each character, whereas the ASCII character set requires one.\\n B.69  Escape characters. Suppose we want to display the following line on the screen:\\nThe word “Java” names a language and a drink!\\nThis string contains quotes, so the statement\\nSystem.out.println(\"The word \"Java\" names a language and a drink!\");\\nwill not work: It produces a compiler error message. The problem is that the compiler sees\\n\"The word \"\\nas a perfectly valid quoted string. Then the compiler sees\\nJava\"\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

The compiler does not know that we mean to include the \\nquote character as part of the string unless we tell it that we want to do so. We tell the compiler this by placing a backslash \\n\\\\ before the troublesome character, like so:\\nSystem.out.println(\"The word \\\\\"Java\\\\\" names a language and a drink!\");\\nSome other special characters also need a backslash in order to be included in strings. They \\nare listed in Figure B-4. These are often called escape characters because they escape from the usual meaning of a character in Java, such as the usual meaning of the double-quote character.\\nFiGUR e B-4 Escape characters\\n\\\\\" Double quote.\\n\\\\\\' Single quote (apostrophe).\\\\\\\\ Backslash.\\\\n New line . (Go to the beginning of the next line.)\\n\\\\r Carriage return. (Go to the beginning of the current line.)\\\\t Tab. (Insert whitespace up to the next tab stop.)\\nIt is important to note that each escape sequence is a single character, even though it is spelled \\nwith two symbols. So the string \"Say \\\\\"Hi\\\\\"!\"  contains 9 characters, not 11.\\nTo include a backslash in a string, you must write two backslashes. Displaying the string \\n\"abc\\\\\\\\def\"  on the screen would produce\\nabc\\\\def\\nWriting the string with only one backslash, as in \"abc\\\\def\" , is likely to produce the error \\nmessage “Invalid escape character,” because \\\\d is invalid.\\nThe escape sequence \\\\n indicates that the string starts a new line at the \\\\n. For example, the \\nstatement\\nSystem.out.println(\"The motto is\\\\nGo for it!\");\\nwill write the following to the screen\\nThe motto is\\nGo for it!\\nYou can include a single quote (apostrophe) inside a quoted string, such as \"How\\'s this?\" , \\nbut you cannot write a single quote within single quotes. Thus, to define a single-quote character, \\nyou use the escape sequence \\\\\\', as follows:\\nchar singleQuote = \\'\\\\\\'\\';\\n Concatenation of Strings\\n B.70  You can join two strings by using the + operator. Joining two strings together, end to end, to obtain \\na larger string is called concatenation. When + is used with strings, it is sometimes called the \\nconcatenation operator. For example, the statements\\nString greeting = \"Hello\";\\nString sentence = greeting + \"my friend.\";System.out.println(sentence);\\nset the variable sentence  to \"Hellomy friend.\"  and will write the following on the screen:\\nHellomy friend.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 37}, page_content='B-38  Appendix B   Java Basics\\nNo space separates the first two words, because no spaces are added when you concatenate two \\nstrings. If we want sentence  to contain \"Hello my friend.\" , we could change the assignment \\nstatement to\\nsentence = greeting + \" my friend.\";\\nNotice the space before the word “my.”\\nYou can concatenate any number of String  objects by using the + operator. You can even \\nconcatenate a String  object to any other type of object and get a String  object as a result. Java \\ncan express any object as a string when you concatenate it to a string. For primitives like numbers, Java does the obvious thing. For example,\\nString solution = \"The answer is \" + 42;\\nwill set the String  variable solution  to \"The answer is 42\" . This is so natural that it may \\nseem as though nothing special is happening, but it does require a real conversion from one type to another. The Java literal \\n42 is an integer, whereas \"42\"  is a string consisting of the two \\ncharacters 4 and 2. Java converts the integer constant 42 to the string constant \"42\"  and then \\nconcatenates the two strings \"The answer is \"  and \"42\"  to obtain the longer string \\n\"The  answer is 42\" .\\nNote:  Every class has a method toString  that Java uses to get a string representation of any \\nobject. If you do not define toString  for a class that you write, the default toString  will return \\na representation of an object’s location in memory. Thus, you generally should provide your \\nown toString  method when you define a class. Appendixes C and D discuss this method in \\nmore detail.\\nYou can also concatenate a single character to a string by using +. For example,\\nString label = \"mile\";String pluralLabel = label + \\'s\\';\\nsets pluralLabel  to the string \"miles\" .\\nSegment B.73 will show you another way to concatenate strings.\\n String  Methods\\nReaders who need to review Java methods should consult Appendix C before reading this section.\\n B.71  A String  object has methods as well as a value. You use these methods to manipulate string values. \\nA few of these String  methods are described here. You invoke, or call, a method for a String  object \\nby writing the object name, a dot, and the name of the method, followed by a pair of parentheses. \\nSome methods require nothing within the parentheses, while others require that you specify argu-ments. Let’s look at some examples.\\n B.72  The method length . The method length  gets the number of characters in a string. For example, \\nsuppose we declare two String  variables as follows:\\nString command = \"Sit Fido!\";  // 9 characters\\nString answer = \"bow-wow\";     // 7 characters\\nNow command.length()  has the value 9 (it returns 9), and answer.length()  returns 7. Notice \\nthat you must include a pair of parentheses, even though there are no arguments to the method \\nlength . Also notice that spaces, special symbols, and repeated characters are all counted in \\ncomputing the length of a string. All characters except the double quotes that enclose the string \\nare counted.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 38}, page_content='The Class String   B-39\\nYou can use a call to the method length  anywhere that you can use a value of type int. For \\nexample, all of the following are legal Java statements:\\nint count = command.length();\\nSystem.out.println(\"Length is \" + command.length());count = answer.length() + 3;\\n B.73  The method concat . You can use the method concat  instead of the + operator to concatenate two \\nstrings. For example, if we declare the String  variables\\nString one = \"sail\";String two = \"boat\";\\nthe expressions\\none + two\\nand\\none.concat(two);\\nare the same string, sailboat.\\n B.74  Indices. Some of the methods in the class String  refer to the positions of the characters in the \\nstring. Positions in a string start with 0, not with 1. Thus, in the string \"Hi Mom\" , H is in position \\n0, i is in position 1, the blank character is in position 2, and so forth. A position is usually referred \\nto as an index. So it would be more normal to say that H  is at index 0, i  is at index 1, and so on. \\nFigure B-5 illustrates how index positions are numbered in a string.\\nFiGUR e B-5 Indices 0 through 11 for the string \"Java is fun.\"\\n01 23 45 67 89 10 11\\nJ a v a i s f u n .\\n B.75  The methods charAt  and indexOf . The method charAt  returns the character at the index given \\nas its one argument. For example, the statements\\nString phrase = \"Time flies like an arrow.\";char sixthCharacter = phrase.charAt(5);\\nassign the character f  to the variable sixthCharacter , since the f  in flies is at index 5. (Remember, \\nthe first index is 0, not 1.)\\nThe method indexOf  tests whether a string contains a given substring and, if it does, returns \\nthe index at which the substring begins. Thus, phrase.indexOf(\"flies\")  will return 5 because \\nthe substring flies begins at index 5 within phrase .\\nNote:  Out-of-bounds index\\nString  methods such as charAt  that take an index as an argument will cause an error during \\n execution if the index is negative or too large. Such an index is said to be out of bounds. The \\n error causes a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException . Java Interludes 2 and 4 discuss exceptions.\\n B.76  Changing case. The method toLowerCase  returns a string obtained from its argument string by \\nreplacing any uppercase letters with their lowercase counterparts. Thus, if greeting  is defined by\\nString greeting = \"Hi Mary!\";\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

An analogous method, toUpperCase , converts any lowercase letters \\nin a string to uppercase. Note the capital C  in toLowerCase  and toUpperCase .\\n B.77  The method trim . The method trim  trims off any leading and trailing white space, such as blanks. \\nSo the statements\\nString command = \"   Sit Fido!    \";\\nString trimmedCommand = command.trim();\\nset trimmedCommand  to the string \"Sit Fido!\" . The blanks between words are not affected.\\n B.78  Comparing strings. You use the method compareTo  to compare two strings. Strings are ordered \\naccording to the Unicode values of their characters. This ordering—called lexicographic ordering—is \\nanalogous to alphabetic ordering. The expression\\nstringOne.compareTo(stringTwo)\\nreturns a negative integer or a positive integer, depending on whether stringOne  occurs before or \\nafter stringTwo . The expression returns zero if the two strings are equal.\\nThe method compareToIgnoreCase  behaves similarly to compareTo , except that the uppercase and \\nlowercase versions of the same letter are considered to be equal. For example, the method compareTo  \\nplaces the string \"Hello\"  before the string \"hello\" , but the method compareToIgnoreCase  finds these \\nstrings to be equal.\\nProgramming Tip:  Do not use the operators ==, !=, <, <=, >, or >= to compare the contents \\nof two strings.\\nIf you want only to see whether two strings are equal—that is, contain the same values—you \\ncan use the method equals . Thus,\\nstringOne.equals(stringTwo)\\nis true if stringOne  equals stringTwo  and is false if they are not equal. The method equals- \\nIgnoreCase  behaves similarly to equals , except that the uppercase and lowercase versions \\nof the same letter are equal. For example, the method equals  finds the strings \"Hello\"  and \\n\"hello\"  unequal, but the method equalsIgnoreCase  finds them equal.\\nProgramming Tip:  When applied to two strings (or to any two objects), the operator == \\ntests whether they are stored in the same memory location. Sometimes that is sufficient, but if  \\nyou want to know whether two strings that are in different memory locations contain the same \\nsequence of characters, use the method equals .\\nThe Class StringBuilder\\n B.79  Once you create a string object of the class String , you cannot alter it. But sometimes you would \\nlike to. For example, we might define the string\\nString name = \"rover\";\\nand then decide that we want to capitalize its first letter. We cannot. We could, of course, write\\nname = \"Rover\";\\nbut this statement creates a new string Rover and discards rover.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

For example, you can create an array of seven numbers of type \\ndouble  as follows:\\ndouble[] temperature = new double[7];\\nThe left side of the assignment operator declares temperature  as an array whose contents are of \\ntype double . The right side uses the new operator to request seven memory locations for the array. \\nThis is like declaring the following strangely named variables to have type double :\\ntemperature[0] , temperature[1] , temperature[2] , temperature[3] ,\\ntemperature[4] , temperature[5] , temperature[6]\\nNote that the numbering starts with 0, not 1. Each of these seven variables can be used just like any other variable of type \\ndouble . For example, we can write\\ntemperature[3] = 32;\\ntemperature[6] = temperature[3] + 5;System.out.println(temperature[6]);\\nBut these seven variables are more than just seven plain old variables of type double . The \\nnumber in square brackets—called an index, or subscript—can be any arithmetic expression whose \\nvalue is an integer. In this example, the index value must be between 0 and 6, because we declared \\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

A variable such as temperature[3]  is \\ncalled either an indexed variable, a subscripted variable, or simply an element of the array. The \\nvalue in an indexed variable is called an entry, and its data type is the array’s entry type.\\nFor example, the following statements read seven temperatures into an array and compare \\nthem with their average:\\npublic static final int DAYS_PER_WEEK = 7;\\nScanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);. . .\\ndouble[] temperature = new double[DAYS_PER_WEEK];System.out.println(\"Enter \" + DAYS_PER_WEEK + \" temperatures:\");\\ndouble sum = 0;for (int index = 0; index < DAYS_PER_WEEK; index++){   temperature[index] = keyboard.nextDouble();   sum = sum + temperature[index];} // end for\\ndouble average = sum / DAYS_PER_WEEK;System.out.println(\"The average temperature is \" + average);\\nSystem.out.println(\"The temperatures are\");for (int index = 0; index < DAYS_PER_WEEK; index++){   if (temperature[index] < average)      System.out.println(temperature[index] + \" below average.\");   else if (temperature[index] > average)      System.out.println(temperature[index] + \" above average.\");   else // temperature[index] == average      System.out.println(temperature[index] + \" average.\");} // end for\\nFigure B-7 illustrates the array temperature  after seven values have been read into it.\\nFiGUR e B-7 An array of seven temperatures\\ntemperature[5]The array temperatureIndices 01 23 45 6\\n32 30 25.7 26 34 31.5 29\\nEach location in the array temperature  contains a temperature.

You can pass an indexed variable as an argument to a method anyplace that you \\ncan pass an ordinary variable of the array’s entry type. For example, if a method has the header\\npublic double compute(double value)\\nand temperature  is the array of double  values that we defined earlier, we can invoke the method \\nby writing\\ndouble result = compute(temperature[3])\\nAn entire array can also be a single argument to a method. For example, the following method\\npublic static void incrementArrayBy2(double[] array)\\n{   for (int index = 0; index < array.length; index++)      array[index] = array[index] + 2;} // end incrementArrayBy2\\nwill accept any array of double  values as its single argument. We declare the parameter array  in \\nthe method’s header just as we would declare any other array: by specifying the type of the array \\nentries followed by square brackets. We do not specify the length of the array.\\nThe following statement is an example of how we would invoke this method:\\nincrementArrayBy2(temperature);\\nYou use no square brackets when you pass an entire array as an argument to a method. Notice that the method can take any length array as an argument. The method \\nincrementArrayBy2  adds 2 to \\neach entry in the argument array temperature . That is, the method actually changes the values in \\nthe argument array.\\nNote:  A method can change the values in an argument array. However, a method cannot  \\nreplace an argument array with another array.\\n B.88  Arrays as return values. In Java, a method can return an array. For example, rather than modi-fying its array argument, the previous method \\nincrementArrayBy2  could return an array whose \\nvalues are 2 more than the corresponding values in the array argument. You specify the method’s return type in the same way that you specify a type for an array parameter. The method would then look like this:\\npublic static double[] incrementArrayBy2(double[] array)\\n{   double[] result = new double[array.length];   for (int index = 0; index < array.length; index++)      result[index] = array[index] + 2;   return result;} // end incrementArrayBy2\\nThe following statements invoke this method:\\ndouble[] originalArray = new double[10];\\n< Statements that place values into originalArray  >\\n. . .\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

For example, to \\ninvoke the method in the previous example, you do not write\\ndouble[] revisedArray = new double[10]; // WRONG!revisedArray = incrementArrayBy2(originalArray);\\nThe first statement allocates 10 locations for a new array, but these locations are discarded when the second statement executes.\\n Initializing Arrays\\n B.89  You can provide initial values for the elements in an array when you declare it. To do this, you \\nenclose the values for the array in braces and place them after the assignment operator, as in the following example:\\ndouble[] reading = {3.3, 15.8, 9.7};\\nYou do not explicitly state the array’s length. Instead the length is the minimum number of loca-tions that will hold the given values. This initializing declaration is equivalent to the following statements:\\ndouble[] reading = new double[3];\\nreading[0] = 3.3;reading[1] = 15.8;reading[2] = 9.7;\\nIf you do not initialize the elements of an array, they are given initial default values according \\nto their type. For example, if you do not initialize an array of integers, each element of the array \\nwill be initialized to zero. In an array of objects, each element is initialized to null . However, it \\nis usually clearer to do your own explicit initialization, either when you declare the array or later by using a loop and assignment statements.\\n Array Index Out of Bounds\\n B.90  When programming with arrays, making a mistake with an index is easy. This is especially true if that index is an expression. If the array \\ntemperature  has seven elements, but an index \\nis some  integer other than 0 through 6, the index is said to be out of bounds. An out-of-bounds \\nindex expression will compile without any error message, but will cause an error when you run your program. In particular, you will get an \\nIndexOutOfBoundsException . As we mentioned in \\n Segment  B.75, a similar situation can occur when you work with strings. (Java Interludes 2 and 4 \\ndiscuss exceptions.)\\n Use of = and == with Arrays\\n B.91  The operator =. Recall that a variable for an object really contains the memory address of the \\nobject. The same is true of arrays. All array locations are together in one section of memory so that one memory address can specify the location of the entire array. The assignment operator copies this memory address. For example, if \\na and b are arrays of the same size, the assignment \\nb = a gives the array variable b the same memory address as the array variable a. In other words, \\na and b are two different names for the same array. These variables are aliases. Thus, when you \\nchange the value of a[2] , you are also changing the value of b[2] . Appendix C talks more about \\naliases and references.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 47}, page_content='B-48  Appendix B   Java Basics\\nIf you want the array b to have the same values as the array a, but in separate memory loca-\\ntions, then instead of one assignment statement you must use a loop like the following one:\\nfor (int index = 0; index < a.length; index++)\\n   b[index] = a[index];\\n B.92  The operator  ==. The equality operator == tests two arrays to see if they are stored in the same \\nplace in the computer’s memory. It does not test whether the arrays contain the same values. To \\ndo so, you must compare the two arrays entry by entry. For example, if the arrays a and b contain \\nprimitive values and have the same length, the following code could be used:\\nboolean match = true;\\nint index = 0;while (match && (index < a.length)){   if (a[index] != b[index])      match = false;   else      index++;} // end while\\nif (match)\\n   System.out.println(\"Arrays have the same contents\");else   System.out.println(\"Arrays have different contents\");\\nIf the arrays contained objects instead of primitive values, we would use the boolean expression \\n!a[index].equals(b[index])  instead of a[index] != b[index] .\\nNote:  Are arrays really objects?\\nArrays behave very much like objects. On the other hand, arrays do not belong to any class. \\n Because arrays were used by programmers for many years before classes and objects (as we have used them) were invented, arrays use a special notation of their own. Other features of \\n objects do not apply to arrays, such as inheritance (which we discuss in Appendix D). So \\n whether or not arrays should be considered objects is primarily an academic debate. Whenever Java documentation says that something applies to all objects, it also applies to arrays.\\nNote:  Array types are reference types\\nA variable of an array type holds only the address where the array is stored in memory. This memory address is often called a reference to the array object in memory. For this reason, an \\n array type is a reference type. A reference type is any type whose variables hold references—that is, memory addresses—as opposed to the actual item named by the variable. Array types and class types are both reference types. Primitive types are not reference types.\\n Arrays and the For-Each Loop\\n B.93  Earlier in Segment B.63 we used a for-each loop to process all the values in an enumeration. We \\ncan use a similar for-each loop to process all the values in an array. For example, the following statements compute the sum of the integers in an array:\\nint[] anArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\\nint sum = 0;\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

For example, suppose we wanted to store the \\ndollar amounts shown in Figure B-8 in some sort of array. The bold items are just labeling. There are 60 entries. If we use an array with one index, the array will have a length of 60, and keeping track of which entry goes with which index would be almost impossible. On the other hand, if we allow ourselves two indices, we can use one index for the row and one index for the column. This arrangement is illustrated in Figure B-9.\\nFiGUR e B-8 A table of values\\nThe effect of various interest rates on $1000 when \\ncompounded annually (rounded to whole dollars )\\nYear 5.00% 5.50% 6.00% 6.50% 7.00% 7.50%\\n1 $105 0 $105 5 $106 0 $106 5 $107 0 $107 5\\n2 $110 3 $111 3 $112 4 $113 4 $114 5 $115 6\\n3 $115 8 $117 4 $119 1 $120 8 $122 5 $124 2\\n4 $121 6 $123 9 $126 2 $128 6 $131 1 $133 5\\n5 $127 6 $130 7 $133 8 $137 0 $140 3 $143 6\\n6 $134 0 $137 9 $141 9 $145 9 $150 1 $154 3\\n7 $140 7 $145 5 $150 4 $155 4 $160 6 $165 9\\n8 $147 7 $153 5 $159 4 $165 5 $171 8 $178 3\\n9 $155 1 $161 9 $168 9 $176 3 $183 8 $191 7\\n10 $162 9 $170 8 $179 1 $187 7 $196 7 $206 1\\nNote that, as was true for the simple arrays you have already seen, you begin numbering \\nindices with 0 rather than 1. If the array is named table  and it has two indices, the Java notation \\ntable[3][2]  specifies the entry in the fourth row and third column. By convention, we think of \\nthe first index as denoting the row and the second as denoting the column. Arrays that have exactly two indices can be displayed on paper as a two-dimensional table and are called two-dimensional arrays. More generally, an array is said to be an n -dimensional array if it has n  indices. Thus, the \\nordinary one-index arrays that we have used up to now are one-dimensional arrays.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

To declare and create \\nthe array table  with 10 rows and 6 columns, we write\\nint[][] table = new int[10][6];\\nYou can have arrays with any number of indices. To get more indices, you just use more square brackets in the declaration.\\nIndexed variables for multidimensional arrays are just like indexed variables for one-dimen-\\nsional arrays, except that they have multiple indices, each enclosed in a pair of square brackets. For example, the following statements set all the elements in \\ntable  to zero:\\nfor (int row = 0; row < 10; row++)\\n   for (int column = 0; column < 6; column++)      table[row][column] = 0;\\nNote that we used two for loops, one nested within the other. This is a common way of stepping \\nthrough the indexed variables in a two-dimensional array. If we had three indices, we would use \\nthree nested for loops, and so forth for higher numbers of indices.\\nAs was true of the indexed variables for one-dimensional arrays, indexed variables for multi-\\ndimensional arrays are variables of the array’s entry type and can be used anywhere that a variable of the entry type is allowed. For example, for the two-dimensional array \\ntable , an indexed vari-\\nable such as table[3][2]  is a variable of type int and can be used anyplace that an ordinary int \\nvariable can be used.\\nA multidimensional array can be a parameter of a method. For example, the following method \\nheader has a two-dimensional array as a parameter:\\npublic static void clearArray(double[][] array)\\n B.96  Java implements multidimensional arrays as one-dimensional arrays. For example, consider the array\\nint[][] table = new int[10][6];\\nThe array table  is in fact a one-dimensional array of length 10, and its entry type is int[] . Thus, \\neach entry in the array table  is a one-dimensional array of length 6. In other words, a multidimen-\\nsional array is an array of arrays.\\nNormally, you do not need to be concerned with this fact, since this detail is handled auto-\\nmatically by the compiler. However, sometimes you can profit from this knowledge. For example, consider the previous nested \\nfor loops that filled the two-dimensional array table  with zeros. We \\nused the constants 6 and 10 to control the for loops, but it would be better style to use the data \\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

To do so, we need to think in terms of an array of arrays. For example, the \\nfollowing is a rewrite of the nested for loops:\\nfor (int row = 0; row < table.length; row++)\\n   for (int column = 0; column < table[row].length; column++)      table[row][column] = 0;\\nHere, table.length  is the number of rows in table , and table[row].length  is the number of columns.\\nWrapper Classes\\n B.97  Java makes a distinction between the primitive types, such as int, double , and char , and the class \\ntypes, such as String  and the classes that you write. Java sometimes treats primitive types and class \\ntypes differently. For example, an argument to a method and the assignment operator = behave dif-\\nferently for primitive types and class types. To make things uniform, Java provides a wrapper class \\nfor each of the primitive types that enables us to convert a value of a primitive type to an object of a corresponding class type.\\nFor example, the wrapper class for the primitive type \\nint is the predefined class Integer . If \\nwe want to convert an int value, such as 10, to an object of type Integer , we can do so in one of \\nthree ways, as the following statements demonstrate:\\nInteger ten = new Integer(10);\\nInteger fiftyTwo = new Integer(\"52\");Integer eighty = 80;\\nIn the first way, you supply an int value as a literal, a variable, or an expression. In the second, \\nyou provide a string that contains an int value. The third way allows you to simply assign an int \\nvalue without using the new operator.\\n B.98  Once you have defined Integer  objects, you can compare them by using the methods compareTo  \\nand equals , much as you compare strings or the other objects we have discussed in this appendix. \\nDo not use operators such as ==. Just as for strings and other objects, operators like == compare \\nthe memory addresses of objects, not their values.\\nIf you need the value of an Integer  object as a primitive, you can use methods such as intValue  \\nor doubleValue . For example, if ten is defined as in the previous segment, the expression\\nten.intValue()\\nreturns the int value 10, whereas\\nten.doubleValue()\\nreturns the double  value 10.0. You also can simply assign the Integer  object to an int variable, as in\\nint primitive10 = ten;\\nNo type cast is necessary; however, using one is not an error.\\n B.99  Boxing and unboxing. When performing arithmetic with Integer  objects, for example, you can \\nuse the same operators that you use for arithmetic with primitives. You can also intermix primitive \\nintegers with Integer  objects. Thus, you can write statements such as the following:\\nScanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);\\nSystem.out.print(\"What is his age? \");int hisAge = keyboard.nextInt();System.out.print(\"What is her age? \");Integer herAge = keyboard.nextInt();\\nInteger ageDifference = Math.abs(hisAge - herAge);\\nSystem.out.println(\"He is \" + hisAge + \", she is \" + herAge +                   \": a difference of \" + ageDifference + \".\");\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 51}, page_content='B-52  Appendix B   Java Basics\\nJava converts between int and Integer  as necessary. The process of converting from a primitive \\ntype to a corresponding wrapper class is called boxing. Unboxing is the process used to convert in \\nthe other direction. Since these conversions happen automatically, they are often called auto-boxing \\nand auto-unboxing. Realize that the previous statements are just a demonstration of what is pos-\\nsible. Using only primitive integers for this simple computation is certainly adequate.\\n B.100  The wrapper classes for the primitive types double , float , long , and char  are Double , Float , \\nLong , and Character , respectively. You create objects of these classes in a way analogous to how \\nyou create Integer  objects. Except for Character , each wrapper class has methods that return a \\nvalue in a variety of types. Integer  has the methods doubleValue , floatValue , intValue , and \\nlongValue . Double , Float , and Long  also have these same methods. The class Character  has only \\nthe analogous method charValue .\\nMany of the classes that we study in this book represent collections of objects. If your data \\nhas a primitive type, an appropriate wrapper class enables you to represent the data as objects so that you can use these classes.\\n B.101  Wrapper classes also contain some useful static constants. For example, you can find the largest and smallest values of any of the primitive number types by using the associated wrapper class. The largest and smallest values of type \\nint are\\nInteger.MAX_VALUE and Integer.MIN_VALUE\\nThe largest and smallest values of type double  are\\nDouble.MAX_VALUE and Double.MIN_VALUE\\n B.102  Wrapper classes have static methods that can be used to convert a string to the corresponding number of type \\nint, double , long , or float . For example, suppose your program needs to convert \\nthe string \"199.98\"  to a double  value (which will turn out to be 199.98, of course). The static \\nmethod parseDouble  of the wrapper class Double  will convert a string to a value of type double . \\nSo if theString  is a variable of type String  whose value is \"199.98\" ,\\nDouble.parseDouble(theString)\\nreturns the double  value 199.98. The other wrapper classes Integer , Long , and Float  have the \\nanalogous methods parseInt , parseLong , and parseFloat .\\nIf there is any possibility that the string named by theString  has extra leading or trailing \\nblanks, you should instead use\\nDouble.parseDouble(theString.trim())\\nAs we discussed in Segment B.77, the method trim , included in the class String , trims off \\nleading or trailing white space, such as blanks. If the string is not a correctly formed number, the invocation of \\nDouble.parseDouble  will cause an exception. The use of trim  helps some in \\navoiding this problem.\\n B.103  Each of the numeric wrapper classes also has a static method called toString  that will convert in \\nthe other direction—that is, it will convert from a primitive numeric value to a string representa-tion of the numeric value. For example,\\nInteger.toString(42)\\nreturns the string value \"42\" , and\\nDouble.toString(199.98)\\nreturns the string value \"199.98\" . Additionally, each wrapper class, like all other classes, has a \\nnonstatic version of toString . For example, if we define n as follows:\\nInteger n = new Integer(198);\\nthen n.toString()  returns the string \"198\" .\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

The following piece of code illustrates \\nsome of the basic methods for this class:\\nCharacter c1 = new Character(\\'a\\');Character c2 = new Character(\\'A\\');if (c1.equals(c2))   System.out.println(c1.charValue() + \" is the same as \" + c2.charValue());\\nelse\\n   System.out.println(c1.charValue() + \" is not the same as \" + c2.charValue());\\nThis code displays\\na is not the same as A\\nThe equals  method checks for equality of characters, so uppercase and lowercase letters are con-\\nsidered different.\\nSome of the static methods in the class Character  follow:\\npublic static char toLowerCase(char ch)\\nReturns the lowercase equivalent of ch, if ch is a letter; otherwise returns ch.\\nExamples:\\nCharacter.toLowerCase(\\'a\\')  returns \\'a\\'\\nCharacter.toLowerCase(\\'A\\')  returns \\'a\\'\\nCharacter.toLowerCase(\\'5\\')  returns \\'5\\'\\npublic static char toUpperCase(char ch)\\nReturns the uppercase equivalent of ch, if ch is a letter; otherwise returns ch.\\nExamples:\\nCharacter.toUpperCase(\\'a\\')  returns \\'A\\'\\nCharacter.toUpperCase(\\'A\\')  returns \\'A\\'\\nCharacter.toUpperCase(\\'5\\')  returns \\'5\\'\\npublic static boolean isLowerCases(char ch)\\nReturns true if ch is a lowercase letter.\\nExamples:\\nCharacter.isLowerCase(\\'a\\')  returns true\\nCharacter.isLowerCase(\\'A\\')  returns false\\nCharacter.isLowerCase(\\'5\\')  returns false\\npublic static boolean isUpperCase(char ch)\\nReturns true if ch is an uppercase letter.\\nExamples:\\nCharacter.isUpperCase(\\'a\\')  returns false\\nCharacter.isUpperCase(\\'A\\')  returns true\\nCharacter.isUpperCase(\\'5\\')  returns false\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

This class has the two constants Boolean.TRUE  and \\n Boolean.FALSE . However, the Java reserved words true  and false  are much easier to use for \\nthese constants. So the constants in the class Boolean  will not be of much help to us. The methods \\nof the class Boolean  are also not used very often. Although the class Boolean  is not useless, it will \\nbe of little use to us in this text and we will discuss it no further.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

Generally, a class con-\\ntains several methods, each defining a specific task and each having a name of our choosing. An \\napplication program, however, must contain a method that is called main .\\n B.5 The line\\nScanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);\\ngets us ready to read data from the keyboard using Java’s class Scanner . It defines the  Scanner  \\nobject keyboard  and associates it with the object System.in . This latter object represents the \\ncomputer’s keyboard. System.in  is in the class System , which is in the package java.lang  of the \\nJava Class Library.\\nProgramming Tip:  No import  statement is necessary when you use a class from the \\n package java.lang  of the Java Class Library.\\n B.6 The next three lines display text for the user of the program:\\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello out there.\");\\nSystem.out.println(\"Want to talk some more?\");System.out.println(\"Answer yes or no.\");\\nEach of these lines causes the quoted characters, or string, given within the parentheses to be \\ndisplayed on the screen. System.out  is an object within the class System  that can send output to \\nthe screen via its method println . You invoke an object’s method by writing the object name fol-\\nlowed by a period, or dot, followed by the method name and some parentheses that may or may not have something inside them. The text inside the parentheses is called an argument and provides the information the method needs to carry out its action. In each of these three lines, the method \\nprintln  writes the value of its argument—here, the characters inside the quotes—to the screen.\\nThe method println  is an example of a void method. It performs an action, but does not \\nreturn a value.\\n B.7 The next line of the program reads the characters that are typed at the keyboard and stores them in the variable \\nanswer  as a string:\\nString answer = keyboard.next();\\nYou use the Scanner  object keyboard  to invoke its method next . In this way, you read the word \\nthat the user types at the keyboard. The user presses the Enter key (also called the Return key) after typing the word. Although the method \\nnext  has no arguments, the parentheses are required. \\nYou will learn more about the class Scanner  later in this appendix.\\nThe method next  is an example of a valued method. It returns the value read. Its invocation, \\nkeyboard.next() , represents this value.\\n B.8 The next two lines of the program make a decision to do or not do something based on the value of the variable \\nanswer . The first line asks whether the string stored in answer  is the string yes . If \\nit is, a message is displayed on the screen. Otherwise, the message is not displayed.\\nNotice that the first sample dialogue in Figure B-1 displays the string Nice weather we are \\n having, and the second one does not. That is because, in the first run of the program, the string yes is \\nstored in the variable answer , and in the second run of the program, the string no is stored in answer .\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

If you are not familiar with these concepts, you should read at least \\nSegment C.1 in Appendix C now and the rest of Appendix C later.\\n A First Java Application Program\\n B.3 To give you a feel for the Java language, let’s take a brief, informal look at the following sample Java application program:\\nimport java.util.Scanner;\\npublic class FirstProgram{   public static void main(String[] args)   {      Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);      System.out.println(\"Hello out there.\");      System.out.println(\"Want to talk some more?\");      System.out.println(\"Answer yes or no.\");\\n      String answer = keyboard.next();\\n      if (answer.equals(\"yes\"))         System.out.println(\"Nice weather we are having.\");      System.out.println(\"Good-bye.\");   } // end main} // end FirstProgram\\nThe program is stored in the file FirstProgram.java .\\nFigure B-1 shows two screen displays that might be produced when a user runs and interacts \\nwith this program. The text typed by the user is shown in bold.\\nFiGUR e B-1  Two possible results when running the sample program\\nHello out there.\\nWant to talk some more?Answer yes or no.yesNice weather we are having.Good-bye.Hello out there.Want to talk some more?Answer yes or no.noGood-bye.\\n B.4 This program uses the class Scanner , which is a part of the Java Class Library. This library con-\\ntains many standard classes that you can use in your Java programs. The classes in the library are organized into groups called packages. The \\nimport  statement indicates that this program uses the \\nclass Scanner  from the package java.util .\\nThe program contains the definition of a class that begins with the lines\\npublic class FirstProgram\\n{\\nand ends with\\n} // end FirstProgram\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='B-4  Appendix B   Java Basics\\nWithin the class definition is a method called main  that begins with the statements\\npublic static void main(String[] args)\\n{\\nand ends with\\n} // end main\\nStatements within this pair of braces are the body of the method main . Generally, a class con-\\ntains several methods, each defining a specific task and each having a name of our choosing. An \\napplication program, however, must contain a method that is called main .\\n B.5 The line\\nScanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);\\ngets us ready to read data from the keyboard using Java’s class Scanner . It defines the  Scanner  \\nobject keyboard  and associates it with the object System.in . This latter object represents the \\ncomputer’s keyboard. System.in  is in the class System , which is in the package java.lang  of the \\nJava Class Library.\\nProgramming Tip:  No import  statement is necessary when you use a class from the \\n package java.lang  of the Java Class Library.\\n B.6 The next three lines display text for the user of the program:\\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello out there.\");\\nSystem.out.println(\"Want to talk some more?\");System.out.println(\"Answer yes or no.\");\\nEach of these lines causes the quoted characters, or string, given within the parentheses to be \\ndisplayed on the screen. System.out  is an object within the class System  that can send output to \\nthe screen via its method println . You invoke an object’s method by writing the object name fol-\\nlowed by a period, or dot, followed by the method name and some parentheses that may or may not have something inside them. The text inside the parentheses is called an argument and provides the information the method needs to carry out its action. In each of these three lines, the method \\nprintln  writes the value of its argument—here, the characters inside the quotes—to the screen.\\nThe method println  is an example of a void method. It performs an action, but does not \\nreturn a value.\\n B.7 The next line of the program reads the characters that are typed at the keyboard and stores them in the variable \\nanswer  as a string:\\nString answer = keyboard.next();\\nYou use the Scanner  object keyboard  to invoke its method next . In this way, you read the word \\nthat the user types at the keyboard. The user presses the Enter key (also called the Return key) after typing the word. Although the method \\nnext  has no arguments, the parentheses are required. \\nYou will learn more about the class Scanner  later in this appendix.\\nThe method next  is an example of a valued method. It returns the value read. Its invocation, \\nkeyboard.next() , represents this value.\\n B.8 The next two lines of the program make a decision to do or not do something based on the value of the variable \\nanswer . The first line asks whether the string stored in answer  is the string yes . If \\nit is, a message is displayed on the screen. Otherwise, the message is not displayed.\\nNotice that the first sample dialogue in Figure B-1 displays the string Nice weather we are \\n having, and the second one does not. That is because, in the first run of the program, the string yes is \\nstored in the variable answer , and in the second run of the program, the string no is stored in answer .\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

For example, a final \\nsemicolon ends each Java statement. These rules form the grammar for the Java language, just as there are rules for the grammar of the English language. The grammar rules for a programming language (or any language) are called the syntax of the language. We now look at the elements of Java in more detail.\\nelements of Java\\nIn this section, we examine how to use Java to perform arithmetic computations.\\n\\t Identifiers\\n B.10  You use identifiers to name certain parts of a program. An identifier in Java consists entirely of letters, digits, the underscore character \\n_, and the dollar sign $. An identifier cannot start with a \\ndigit and must not contain a space or any other special character such as a period or an  asterisk. \\nThere is no official limit to the length of a name, though in practice, there is always a limit. Although Java allows identifiers to contain a dollar sign, it is reserved for special purposes, and so you should not use $ in a Java identifier.\\nJava is case sensitive. This means that it treats uppercase letters and lowercase letters as \\ndifferent characters. For example, \\nmystuff , myStuff , and MyStuff  are three different identifiers. \\nHaving these identifiers in the same program could be confusing to human readers, and therefore doing so is a poor programming practice. But the Java compiler would be happy with them.\\nJava uses a character set, called Unicode, that includes characters from languages other than \\nEnglish. Java allows you to use these extra characters in identifiers, but you are not likely to find them on most keyboards. Segment B.68 discusses Unicode further.\\n B.11  Although it is not required by the Java language, the common practice, and the one followed in this book, is to start the names of classes with uppercase letters and to start the names of objects, methods, and variables (which you are about to see) with lowercase letters. These names are usu -\\nally spelled using only letters and digits. We separate multiword names by using uppercase letters, since we cannot use spaces. For example, the following are all legal identifiers that follow this well-established convention:\\ninputStream   YourClass   CarWash   hotCar   theTimeOfDay\\nSome people use an underscore to separate the words in an identifier , but typically we will not.\\nThe following are all illegal identifiers in Java, and the compiler will complain if you use any \\nof them:\\n.MyClass   goTeam-   7eleven\\nThe first two contain an illegal character, either a dot or a dash. The last name is illegal because it starts with a digit.\\n Reserved Words\\n B.12  Some words, such as the word if, have a special predefined meaning in the Java language. You \\ncannot use these words, called reserved words or keywords, for anything other than their intended meaning. A full list of reserved words for Java is given on the inside cover of this book. Within a programming environment, the names of reserved words are often highlighted in some way. In this book, they will appear in boldface.\\nSome other words, such as \\nString , name classes that are supplied with Java. They have a \\npredefined meaning but are not reserved words. This means that you can change their meaning, but doing so could easily confuse you or somebody else reading your program.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

This value can be changed, \\nso that at one time the variable contains, say, 6, and at another time after the program has run for a while, the variable contains a different value, such as 4.\\nYou use an identifier to name a variable. Besides following the rules and conventions for \\nidentifiers, you should choose variable names that suggest their use or the kind of data they will hold. For example, if a variable is used to count something, you might name the variable \\ncount . \\nIf the variable is used to hold the speed of an automobile, you might call the variable speed . You \\nshould almost never use single-letter variable names like x and y. Also by convention, variable \\nnames begin with a lowercase letter.\\n B.14  A variable’s data type—or simply type—determines what kind of value the variable can hold. If the type is \\nint, the variable can hold integers. If the type is double , the variable can hold numbers \\nwith a decimal point and a fractional part after the decimal point. If the type is char , the variable \\ncan hold any one character from the computer keyboard.\\nJava has two kinds of types, primitive types and reference types. A primitive type represents \\nsimple, indecomposable values, such as a single number or a single letter. The types int, double , \\nand char  are primitive types. A reference type represents a reference, or a memory address, \\ninstead of the actual item stored at that address. A class type—which is a type for objects of a class—is a reference type. For example, \\nString  is a class type. A variable of a reference type is \\ncalled a reference variable. A second kind of reference type is an array type. We will discuss \\narrays in Segment B.86.\\nNote:  Naming conventions help you to distinguish among identifiers when reading a program.  \\nBy convention, variables begin with a lowercase letter, as do the names of primitive types. The \\nnames of class types begin with an uppercase letter.\\n B.15  A variable declaration indicates the type of data the variable will hold. Different types of data \\nare stored in the computer’s memory in different ways. Variable declarations are necessary so \\nthat the value of a variable can be correctly stored in or retrieved from the computer’s memory. Even though the mechanisms for storing values in the variables of class types differ from the \\n mechanisms used for primitive types, you declare variables for class types and primitive types in the same way.\\nYou declare a variable by writing a type name followed by a list of variable names separated \\nby commas and ending with a semicolon. All the variables named in the list will have the type given at the start of the declaration. For example:\\nint numberOfBaskets, eggsPerBasket, totalEggs;\\nString myName;\\nThe first line declares that the three variables numberOfBaskets , eggsPerBasket , and totalEggs  \\nwill contain values of type int. The second line declares that myName  will store a String  object.\\nYou must declare a variable in a Java program before you use it. Normally, you declare a vari-\\nable either just before it is used or at the start of a method definition.\\n Primitive Types\\n B.16  A whole number without a decimal point, such as 0, 1, or −2, is called an integer. A number with \\na decimal point, such as 3.14159, −8.63, or 5.0, is called a floating-point \\tnumber. Notice that 5.0 \\nis a floating-point number, not an integer. If a number has a fractional part, even if the fractional \\npart is zero, it is a floating-point number.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='elements of Java   B-7\\nAll the Java primitive types appear inside the cover of this book. Notice that there are four \\ntypes for integers—namely byte , short , int, and long . The only difference among the various \\ninteger types is the range of integers they can store and the amount of computer memory they use. \\nIf you cannot decide which integer type to use, use the type int. It has a large enough range for \\nmost purposes and does not use as much memory as the type long .\\nJava has two types for floating-point numbers, float  and double . If you cannot decide \\n between the types float  and double , use double . It allows a wider range of values and is used as \\na default type for floating-point numbers.\\nYou use the primitive type char  for single characters, such as letters, digits, or punctuation. \\nFor example, the following declares the variable symbol  to be of type char , stores the character \\nfor uppercase A  in symbol , and then displays that value—the A —on the screen:\\nchar symbol;\\nsymbol = \\'A\\';System.out.println(symbol);\\nNotice that we enclose the character A  in single quotes. Again note that uppercase letters and low-\\nercase letters are different characters. For example, \\'a\\' and \\'A\\' represent two different characters.\\nFinally, the primitive type boolean  has two values, true and false. You can use a variable of \\ntype boolean  to store the answer to a true /false question such as “Is myTime  less than yourTime ?”\\n Constants\\n B.17  A variable can have its value changed; its value varies. A literal number like 2 cannot change. It is \\nalways 2. It is never 3. Values like 2 or 4.8 are called constants, or literals, because their values \\ndo not change.\\nYou write constants of integer types with an optional plus sign or minus sign, but without \\ncommas or decimal points. Floating-point constants have an optional plus sign or a minus sign and no commas. You can write a floating-point constant in one of two ways. One way looks like the everyday way of writing numbers. For example, \\n9.8, -3.14 , and 5.0 are floating-point con-\\nstants, because they contain a decimal point. The second way is to include a multiplier that is a power of 10. You use the letter \\ne to represent both the multiplication sign and the 10. For example, \\nthe number 8.65 × 108 appears in Java as 8.65e8  (or in the less convenient form 865000000.0 ). \\nThe two forms, 8.65e8  and 865000000.0 , are equivalent in a Java program. Similarly, the number \\n4.83 × 10-4, which is equal to 0.000483, can be written as 4.83e-4  in Java.\\nThe e stands for “exponent,” since it is followed by a number that is thought of as an exponent \\nof 10. The number before the e can be a number with or without a decimal point. The number after \\nthe e cannot contain a decimal point.\\nOther types of literal expressions are also called constants. You write constants of type char  \\nby placing the character within single quotes. For example, \\'Y\\' is a constant of type char . A string \\nconstant is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes, as in \"Java\" .\\n Assignment Statements\\n B.18  You can use an assignment statement to give a value to a variable. For example, if answer  is a \\nvariable of type int and we want to give it the value 42, we could use the following assignment \\nstatement:\\nanswer = 42;\\nAn assignment statement always consists of a single variable on the left-hand side of an equal sign and an expression on the right-hand side followed by a semicolon. The expression can be another variable, a constant, or a more complicated expression made up by combining operators, such as \\n+ and *, with variables and constants. The value of the expression is assigned to the variable on \\nthe left of the equal sign.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content=\"B-8  Appendix B   Java Basics\\nFor example, the following are all examples of assignment statements:\\namount = 3.99;\\nfirstInitial = 'B';score = numberOfCards + handicap;\\nHere we assume that amount  is a variable of type double , firstInitial  is of type char , and the \\nrest of the variables are of type int. If the variable numberOfCards  has the value 7 and handicap  \\nhas the value 2, the value of the variable score  is 9.\\nThe equal sign, =, which is called the assignment operator, does not mean equality. You can \\nthink of the assignment operator as saying, “Make the value of the variable equal to what follows.” \\nFor example, in the statement\\neggsPerBasket = eggsPerBasket - 2;\\nthe variable eggsPerBasket  occurs on both sides of the assignment operator. This statement sub-\\ntracts 2 from the present value of eggsPerBasket  and assigns the new value to eggsPerBasket . In \\neffect, the statement decreases the value of eggsPerBasket  by 2.\\n B.19  A variable that has been declared but that has not yet been given a value by the program is \\n uninitialized. Such a variable might literally have no value, or it might have some default value. For example, an integer variable might have a default value of zero, and a reference variable might have a default value of \\nnull , which is a predefined constant in Java. However, your program will \\nbe clearer if you explicitly give the variable a value, even if you are simply reassigning it the default value. (The exact details on default values have been known to change and should not be counted on.)\\nOne easy way to ensure that you do not have an uninitialized variable is to initialize it within \\nthe declaration. Simply combine the declaration and an assignment statement, as in the following examples:\\nint count = 0;\\ndouble taxRate = 0.075;char grade = 'A';int balance = 1000, newBalance;\\nNote that a single declaration, such as the last statement, can initialize some variables and not others.\\nSometimes the compiler may complain that you have failed to initialize a variable. In most \\ncases, this is indeed true. Occasionally, the compiler is mistaken about this. However, the  compiler \\nwill not compile your program until you convince it that the variable in question is initialized. To \\nmake the compiler happy, initialize the variable when it is declared, even if the variable will be given a different value before you use it for anything. In such cases, you cannot argue with the compiler.\\nNote:  A reference variable that contains null  does not reference any object.\\nAssignment Compatibilities\\n B.20  You cannot put a square peg in a round hole, and similarly you cannot put a value of one type in a variable of another type. You cannot put an \\nint value like 42 in a variable of type char . You can-\\nnot put a double  value like 3.5 in a variable of type int. You cannot even put the double  value 3.0 \\nin a variable of type int. You cannot store a value of one type in a variable of another type unless \\nthe value is somehow converted to match the type of the variable.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='elements of Java   B-9\\nWhen dealing with numbers, however, this conversion will sometimes—but not always—be \\nperformed for you automatically. For example, you can always assign a value of an integer type to \\na variable of a floating-point type, such as when you write either\\ndouble interestRate = 7;\\nor\\nint wholeRate = 7;\\ndouble interestRate = wholeRate;\\nMore generally, you can assign a value of any type on the following list to a variable of any \\ntype that appears further down on the list:\\nbyte → short → int → long → float → double\\nFor example, you can assign a value of type long  to a variable whose type is either long , float , \\nor double . Notice that you can assign a value of any integer type to a variable of any floating-point \\ntype. This is not an arbitrary ordering of the types. As you move down the list from left to right, \\nthe types become more complex, or wider, either because they allow larger values or because they allow decimal points in the numbers. Thus, you can assign a value of one type to a variable of either the same type or a wider type.\\nIn addition, you can assign a value of type \\nchar  to a variable of type int or to any of the \\nnumeric types that follow int in the previous list of types. However, we do not advise doing so, \\nbecause the result could be confusing.1\\nIf you want to assign a value of type double  to a variable of type int, you must change the \\ntype of the value explicitly by using a type cast, as we explain next.\\n Type Casting\\n B.21  A type cast is the changing of the type of a value to some other type, such as changing the type \\nof 2.0 from double  to int. The previous segment described when a change in type is done for you \\nautomatically. In all other cases, if you want to assign a value of one type to a variable of another type, you must perform a type cast. For example, you cannot simply assign a value of type \\ndouble  \\nto a variable of type int, even if the value of type double  happens to have all zeros after the decimal \\npoint and so is conceptually a whole number. Thus, the second of the following statements is illegal:\\ndouble distance = 9.0;\\nint points = distance; // ILLEGAL\\nTo cast the type of distance  to int, you enclose int within parentheses and place it in front of \\ndistance . For example, we would replace the preceding illegal assignment with\\nint points = (int)distance; // Casting from double to int\\nNote that when you type-cast from any floating-point type to any integer type, the value is not \\nrounded. The part after the decimal point is simply discarded, or truncated. For example, if the \\nvariable distance  contains 25.86, (int)distance  has an int value of 25. A type cast does not \\nreally change the value of a variable; distance  is still 25.86, but points  is 25.\\nRecall that when you assign an integer value to a variable of a floating-point type, the type \\ncast is done automatically for you.\\n1. Readers who have used certain other languages, such as C or C++, may be surprised to learn that we cannot \\nassign a value of type char to a variable of type byte. This is because Java uses the Unicode character set rather than \\nthe ASCII character set, and so Java reserves two bytes of memory for each value of type char, but naturally reserves \\nonly one byte of memory for values of type byte. This is one of the few cases where we might notice that Java uses \\nthe Unicode character set. Indeed, if we convert from an int to a char or vice versa, we can expect to get the usual \\ncorrespondence of ASCII numbers and characters.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='B-10  Appendix B   Java Basics\\nNote:  When casting, some programmers place a space before the variable, as in (int) sum . \\nWe prefer to treat casting much like a minus sign. Just as we write minus five as –5, we cast sum \\nto an integer by writing (int)sum .\\n Arithmetic Operators and Expressions\\n B.22  In Java, you perform arithmetic by using the arithmetic operators +, -, *, /, and %. You combine \\nvariables and constants with these operators and parentheses to form an arithmetic expression. \\nThe variables and constants in an expression are called operands. Spaces around the operators, operands, and parentheses within an expression are ignored.\\nA unary operator is one that has only one operand, like the operator \\n– in the assignment \\nstatement\\nbankBalance = -cost;\\nA binary operator has two operands, like the operators + and * in\\ntotal = cost + (tax * discount);\\nNote that the operators – and + can be used as both unary and binary operators.\\nThe meaning of an expression is basically what you expect it to be, but there are some subtle -\\nties about the type of the result and occasionally even about the value of the result. The type of the value produced when an expression is evaluated depends on the types of the values being combined. Consider an expression with only two operands, such as\\namount – adjustment\\nIf both amount  and adjustment  are of type int, the result of the subtraction has type int. If either \\namount  or adjustment , or both, is of type double , the result is of type double . If we replace the \\noperator – with any of the operators +, *, /, or %, the type of the result is determined in the same \\nway. However, the operator % is typically used with integers, as you will see soon.\\nLarger expressions using more than two operands are viewed as a series of steps, each of \\nwhich involves only two operands. For example, to evaluate the expression\\nbalance + (balance * rate)\\nwe evaluate balance * rate  and obtain a number, and then we add that number to balance . Thus, \\nif balance  is int and rate  is double , balance * rate  is double  and so is the entire expression.\\nNote:  If all the items in an arithmetic expression have the same type, the result has that type. \\nIf at least one of the items has a floating-point type, the result has a floating-point type.\\nKnowing whether the value produced has an integer type or a floating-point type is typically \\nall that you need. However, if you need to know the exact type of the value produced by an arith -\\nmetic expression, you can use the following rule:\\nNote:  The data type of an arithmetic expression’s value matches the most complex, or widest, \\ndata type among the operands in the expression. In other words, the data type matches the type \\nthat appears rightmost in the following list:\\nbyte → short → int → long → float → double\\nFor example, if sum is float  and more  is int, sum + more  is float .\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='elements of Java   B-1 1\\n B.23  The division operator / deserves special attention, because the type of its operands can affect the \\nvalue produced in a dramatic way. When you combine two numbers with the division operator / \\nand at least one of the numbers has a floating-point type, the result has a floating-point type. For \\nexample, 9.0 / 2 has one operand of type double , namely 9.0. Hence, the result is the type double  \\nnumber 4.5. However, when both operands have an integer type, the result can be surprising. For example \\n9 / 2 has two operands of type int, and so it yields the result 4 of type int, not 4.5. The \\nfraction after the decimal point is simply lost. When you divide two integers, the result is truncated, not rounded. The part after the decimal point is discarded no matter how large it is. So, \\n11 / 3 is 3,  \\nnot 3.6666 . . . . If nothing but a zero is after the decimal point, that decimal point and zero are still lost. Even this seemingly trivial difference can be of some significance. For example, \\n8.0 / 2 has \\nthe value 4.0 of type double , which technically is only an approximate quantity. However, 8 / 2  \\nhas the int value 4, which is an exact quantity. The approximate nature of 4.0 can affect the accu-\\nracy of any further calculation that is performed with this result.\\nOften, the % operator has operands only of integer types. You use it to recover the equiva-\\nlent of the fraction after the decimal point. When you divide one integer by another, you get a result (which some call a quotient) and a remainder. For example, 14 divided by 4 yields 3 with a \\n remainder of 2 (or with 2 left over). The % operation gives the remainder—that is, the amount left \\nover after doing the division. So 14 / 4 is 3 and 14 % 4 is 2, because 14 divided by 4 is 3 with 2 left \\nover. The % operator is called the remainder operator.\\nThe % operator has more applications than you might at first suspect. It allows your program \\nto count by 2s, 3s, or any other number. For example, if you want to do something to every other integer, you need to know whether the integer is even or odd. An integer \\nn is even if n % 2 is zero, \\nand it is odd if n % 2 is not zero. Similarly, if you want your program to do something to every third \\ninteger, you test whether the integer n is divisible by 3. It will be if n % 3 is zero.\\nProgramming Tip:  To make your arithmetic expressions more readable, place a space on \\nboth sides of each binary operator.\\n Parentheses and Precedence Rules\\n B.24  You can use parentheses to group portions of an arithmetic expression in the same way that you use parentheses in algebra and arithmetic. With the aid of parentheses, you can indicate which operations are performed first, second, and so forth. For example, consider the following two expressions that differ only in the positioning of their parentheses:\\n(cost + tax) * discount\\ncost + (tax * discount)\\nTo evaluate the first expression, the application first adds cost  and tax and then multiplies the \\nresult by discount . To evaluate the second expression, it multiplies tax by discount  and then \\nadds the result to cost . If you use some numbers for the values of the variables and carry out the \\ntwo evaluations, you will see that they produce different results.\\nIf you omit parentheses, as in the assignment statement\\ntotal = cost + tax * discount;\\nmultiplication occurs before addition. Thus, the previous statement is equivalent to\\ntotal = cost + (tax * discount);\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='B-12  Appendix B   Java Basics\\nMore generally, when the order of operations is not determined by parentheses, the operations \\n occur in an order determined by the following precedence rule:\\nNote:  Precedence of arithmetic operators\\nArithmetic operators in an expression execute in the order of their precedence, as follows:\\n ● The unary operators +, –\\n ● The binary operators *, /, %\\n ● The binary operators +, –\\nParentheses can override this order.\\nOperators that are listed higher on the list are said to have higher precedence. For example, \\nunary operators have a higher precedence than binary operators, and binary operators have a \\nlower precedence than unary operators. Operators of higher precedence execute before operators of lower precedence, unless parentheses override this order. Operators at the same level have the same precedence. When two operators have equal precedence, the operations are performed using the following convention:\\nNote:  Binary operators of equal precedence in an expression are performed in left-to-right order.\\n Increment and Decrement Operators\\n B.25  The increment and decrement operators increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1. The increment operator is written as two plus signs, \\n++. For example, the following Java statement \\nwill increase the value of the variable count  by 1:\\ncount++;\\nIf the variable count  has the value 5 before this statement is executed, it will have the value 6 after \\nthe statement is executed. Thus, this statement is equivalent to\\ncount = count + 1;\\nYou can use the increment operator with variables of any numeric type, but it is used most often with variables of an integer type such as \\nint.\\nThe decrement operator is similar, except that it subtracts 1 rather than adds 1 to the value of \\nthe variable. The decrement operator is written as two minus signs, ––. For example, the following \\nwill decrease the value of the variable count  by 1:\\ncount--;\\nIf the variable count  has the value 5 before this statement is executed, it will have the value 4 after \\nthe statement is executed. This statement is equivalent to\\ncount = count - 1;\\n B.26  You can use the increment and decrement operators within expressions, but when you do, the increment operator or the decrement operator changes the value of the variable it is applied to and returns a value. Although we do not recommend using the increment and decrement operators in expressions, you might see them used this way in code written by other developers.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

For example, consider the code\\nint n = 3;\\nint m = 4;int result = n * (++m);\\nAfter this code executes, the value of n is unchanged at 3, the value of m is 5, and the value of result  \\nis 15. Thus, ++m changes the value of m and returns that changed value to the multiply operator.\\nIn the previous example, we placed the increment operator before the variable m. If we place \\nit after the variable m, something slightly different happens. Consider the code\\nint n = 3;int m = 4;int result = n * (m++);\\nNow, after the code executes, the value of n is 3 and the value of m is 5, just as in the previous \\nexample. However, the value of result  is 12, not 15, because m++ returns the value of m to the \\nmultiply operator and then changes the value of m.\\nThe two expressions n * (++m)  and n * (m++)  both increase the value of m by 1, but the first \\nexpression increases the value of m before it does the multiplication, whereas the second expres-\\nsion increases the value of m after it does the multiplication. Both ++m and m++ have the same \\n effect on the final value of m, but when we use them as part of an arithmetic expression, they give \\na different value to the expression.\\nSimilarly, both ––m and m–– have the same effect on the final value of m, but when we use them \\nas part of an arithmetic expression, they give a different value to the expression. If the –– is before  \\nthe m, the value of m is decreased before its value is used in the expression. If the –– is after the m, \\nthe value of m is decreased after its value is used in the expression.\\nThe increment and decrement operators can be applied only to variables. They cannot be \\n applied to constants or to entire, more complicated arithmetic expressions.\\nProgramming Tip:  To avoid errors and confusing code, use the operator ++ or –– only in a \\nstatement that involves one variable and no other operators.\\n Special Assignment Operators\\n B.27  You can combine the simple assignment operator ( =) with an arithmetic operator, such as +, to \\nproduce a kind of special-purpose assignment operator. For example, the following will increase \\nthe value of the variable amount  by 5:\\namount += 5;\\nThis is really just a shorthand for\\namount = amount + 5;\\nYou can do the same thing with any of the other arithmetic operators –, *, /, and %. For example, \\nthe statement\\namount *= 25\\nis equivalent to\\namount = amount * 25;\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

However, when you see 3.14159, you might not be sure that it is π and not some other number; somebody other than you might have no idea of where the number 3.14159 came from. To avoid such confusion, you should always give a name to constants, such as 3.14159, and use the name instead of writing out the number. For example, we might give the number 3.14159 the name \\nPI. Then the assignment statement\\narea = 3.14159 * radius * radius;\\ncould be written more clearly as\\narea = PI * radius * radius;\\nHow do you give a number, or other constant, a name like PI? You could use a variable named \\nPI and initialize it to the desired value 3.14159. But then you might inadvertently change the value \\nof this variable. However, Java provides a mechanism that allows you to define and initialize a variable and moreover fix the variable’s value so it cannot be changed. The syntax is\\npublic static final type name  = constant;\\nFor example, the statement\\npublic static final double PI = 3.14159;\\ngives the name PI to the constant 3.14159. The part\\ndouble PI = 3.14159;\\nsimply declares PI as a variable and initializes it to 3.14159. The word public  says that there \\nare no restrictions on where we can use the name PI. The word static  defines one copy of PI \\nthat every object of the class can access instead of having its own copy of PI. The word final  \\nmeans that the value 3.14159 is the final value assigned to PI or, to phrase it another way, it \\nmeans that the program cannot change the value of PI. Appendix C provides more details about \\nstatic  and final .\\nIt is a good practice to place named constants near the beginning of a class and outside of any \\nmethod definitions. That way, your named constants are handy in case you need to modify them. You might, for example, want to change the number of digits you provide for a constant.\\nNote:  The class Math  in the Java Class Library defines a static constant named PI just like \\nthe one we defined in this segment, but with more decimal places. The following segment \\ndescribes this class and shows how to access PI. You should use Math ’s PI instead of defining \\nyour own.\\nProgramming Tip:  Programmers typically use all uppercase letters when naming constants \\nto distinguish constants from ordinary variables. They use an underscore as a separator in multi -\\nword names. For example, FEET_PER_MILE  follows this convention.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

These methods are static methods. (Segment C.28 of Appendix C dis-\\ncusses static methods in more detail.) When you invoke a static method, you write the class name—\\nMath , in this case—a dot, the name of the method, and a pair of parentheses. Using the \\nname of a class to invoke a method is not typical. Ordinarily, you use the name of an object to invoke a method.\\nMost \\nMath  methods require that you specify items within the pair of parentheses. As we noted \\nearlier in this appendix, these items are called arguments to the method. Thus, a typical invocation of a method in this class has the form \\nMath. method_name (arguments ).\\nYou can invoke the method in an assignment statement, such as\\nvariable = Math. method_name (arguments );\\nor embed it within an arithmetic expression. That is, you can use Math. method_name (arguments ) \\nanyplace that you can use a variable of a primitive data type. Figure B-2 describes some of the available methods in this class.\\nThe class \\nMath  also has two predefined named constants. E is the base of the natural logarithm \\nsystem—often written e  in mathematical formulas—and is approximately 2.72. PI is used in cal-\\nculations involving circular geometric figures—often written π in mathematical formulas—and is approximately 3.14159. Because these constants are defined in the class \\nMath , you use them by \\nwriting Math.E  and Math.PI .\\nSimple input and Output Using the Keyboard and Screen\\nThe input and output of data is usually referred to as I /O. A Java program can perform I/O in \\nmany different ways. In this section, we present some ways to handle simple text input that we type at the keyboard and simple text output displayed on the screen.\\n Screen Output\\n B.30  Statements like\\nSystem.out.println(\"Enter a whole number from 1 to 99.\");\\nand\\nSystem.out.println(quarters + \" quarters\");\\nsend output to the display screen. As we mentioned earlier in this appendix, System.out  is an \\nobject within the class System , which is a class in the Java Class Library. This object has println  \\nas one of its methods. So the preceding output statements are calls to the method println  of \\nthe object System.out . You simply follow System.out.println  with a pair of parentheses that \\ncontain what you want to display. You end the statement with a semicolon.\\nWithin the parentheses can be strings of text in double quotes, like \"Enter a whole number \\nfrom 1 to 99.\" , variables like quarters , numbers like 5 or 7.3, and almost any other object \\nor value. To display more than one thing, simply place a + operator between them. For example,\\nSystem.out.println(\"Lucky number = \" + 13 +\\n                   \"Secret number = \" + number);\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

If we want a space between the 13 and the word “Secret” \\nin the preceding output—and we probably do—we should add a space to the beginning of the \\nstring \"Secret number = \"  so that it becomes \" Secret number = \" .\\nNotice that you use double quotes, not single quotes, and that the opening and closing quotes \\nare the same symbol.

You also should indent the second line to make the entire statement \\neasier to read.\\nLater, in the section about the class String , you will see that the + operator joins, or \\n concatenates, two strings. In the preceding System.out.println  statement, Java converts the \\nnumber 13 to the string \"13\" . Likewise, it converts the integer 7 in the variable number  to the \\nstring \"7\". Then the + operator joins the strings and the System.out.println  statement displays \\nthe result. You do need to be a bit careful, however.

If you want the output from two or more output \\nstatements to appear on a single line, use print  instead of println . For example,\\nSystem.out.print(\"One, two,\");System.out.print(\" buckle my shoe.\");System.out.println(\" Three, four,\");System.out.println(\"shut the door.\");\\nwill produce the following output:\\nOne, two, buckle my shoe. Three, four,shut the door.\\nNotice that a new line is not started until you use println , rather than print . Also notice that \\nthe new line starts after displaying the items specified in the println  statement. This is the only \\ndifference between print  and println .\\n Keyboard Input Using the Class Scanner\\n B.32  A Java program can read data from either the keyboard or another source such as a disk, and \\nplace it into memory. The Java Class Library provides the class Scanner  for this purpose. Here, \\nwe will use the methods in Scanner  to read data typed at the keyboard and place it into variables \\nthat we specify.\\nAs we noted earlier, the class Scanner  is in the package java.util . To use Scanner  in your \\nprogram, you must import it from this package by writing the following import  statement before \\nthe rest of your program:\\nimport java.util.Scanner;\\nBefore you can use any of the methods in Scanner , you must create a Scanner  object by writ-\\ning a statement such as\\nScanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);\\nThe variable keyboard —which could be any variable of your choosing—is assigned a Scanner  \\nobject that is associated with the input device that System.in  represents. This device by conven-\\ntion is the keyboard. The variable keyboard  has a class type.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='B-18  Appendix B   Java Basics\\n B.33  Scanner  provides several methods that read input data. You can use any of these methods by \\n writing a statement that has the following form, where keyboard  is the Scanner  object that we \\ndefined previously:\\nvariable = keyboard. method_name ();\\nThe named method reads a value from the keyboard and returns it. That is, the expression \\nkeyboard. method_name () represents the value that was read. The previous statement then \\n assigns this value to the indicated variable.\\nYou can read integers and real numbers by using the following expressions:\\nkeyboard.nextInt() — Returns the next integer encountered in the input data.\\nkeyboard.nextDouble() — Returns the next real number encountered in the input data.\\nEach of these expressions ignores any white space that might precede or follow the number typed \\nat the keyboard. White-space characters are the characters that appear as spaces when printed on paper or displayed on the screen. The blank-space character is likely the only white-space charac -\\nter that will concern us at first, but the start of a new line and the tab symbol are also white-space characters.\\n B.34  Example. To read an integer from the keyboard, you can write a statement such as\\nsize = keyboard.nextInt();\\nwhere size  has been declared previously as an int variable. The user of your program would type \\nan integer and press the Enter, or Return, key. The value is read by the method nextInt , returned, \\nand assigned to the variable size .\\nTypically, you should display a message, or prompt, for the user to enter data. For example, \\nyour program might contain the following statements:\\nSystem.out.println(\"What is your age?\");\\nint age = keyboard.nextInt();\\nWhatever the user types appears in the same window as the prompt. Here, the prompt would  appear \\non one line and the user would type his or her age on the next.\\n B.35  Example. To read a real number from the keyboard, you can write statements such as\\nSystem.out.print(\"Enter the area of your room in square feet: \");double area = keyboard.nextDouble();\\nAfter the user types a real number at the keyboard and presses the Enter key, the value of the \\nnumber is assigned to the variable area . Since we have used print  instead of println , both the \\nprompt and the input data appear on the same line on the display.\\n B.36  Example. You can read more than one value per line of input. For example,\\nSystem.out.println(\"Please enter your height in feet and inches:\");\\nint feet = keyboard.nextInt();int inches = keyboard.nextInt();\\nThe user could type either\\n6 2\\non one line or\\n62\\non two lines. In either case, feet  is 6 and inches  is 2.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

The name of the input stream associated with the keyboard is \\nSystem.in . Likewise, an output stream is an object that directs data \\nfrom your program to an output device. System.out  is such an object, directing characters to \\na display.\\n B.37  More input methods. The class Scanner  includes the following method to read a string:\\nnextLine() — Returns the string that appears next in the input data.\\nFor example, if keyboard  is defined as shown earlier, the statement\\nString message = keyboard.nextLine();\\nreads the entire string that the user types before pressing the Enter key—including any spaces—\\nand assigns it to the variable message .\\nThe method next  in the class Scanner  reads the next group of contiguous characters that are \\nnot white space and returns it as a string. For example, you can use this method to read the next word that appears in the input data, as follows:\\nString word = keyboard.next();\\nWe used next  in Segment B.3 to read the user’s yes or no response.\\nThe Scanner  methods we’ve looked at— nextInt , nextDouble , nextLine , and next —often \\nare invoked in simple assignment statements, although that is not necessary. Since each method returns a value, you can call it within an arithmetic expression, for example.\\nThe if-else  Statement\\n B.38  In programs, as in everyday life, things can sometimes go in one of two different ways. If you have money in your checking account, some banks will pay you a little interest. On the other hand, if you have overdrawn your checking account, you will be charged a penalty. This might be reflected in the bank’s accounting program by the following Java statement, known as an \\nif-else  statement:\\nif (balance >= 0)\\n   balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;else   balance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;\\nThe two-symbol operator >= means “greater than or equal to” in Java. We use two symbols because \\nthe one-character symbol ≥  is not on the keyboard.\\nThe meaning of an if-else  statement is really just the meaning it would have if read as an \\nEnglish sentence. When your program executes an if-else  statement, it first checks the expres-\\nsion in parentheses after the if. This expression must evaluate to either true or false. If it is true, \\nthe statement after the if is executed. If the expression is false, the statement after the else  is \\nexecuted. In the preceding example, if balance  is positive or zero, the following action occurs:\\nbalance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 19}, page_content='B-20  Appendix B   Java Basics\\n(We divide by 12 because the interest is for only 1 of 12 months.) On the other hand, if the value \\nof balance  is negative, the following is executed instead:\\nbalance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;\\nThe indentation in the if-else  statement is conventional as an aid in reading the statement; it does \\nnot affect the statement’s meaning.\\n B.39  If you want to include more than one statement in either of the two portions of the if-else  state-\\nment, you simply enclose the statements in braces, as in the following example:\\nif (balance >= 0)\\n{   System.out.println(\"Good for you. You earned interest.\");   balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;}else{   System.out.println(\"You will be charged a penalty.\");   balance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;} // end if\\nWhen you enclose several statements within braces, you get one larger statement called a \\n compound statement. Compound statements are seldom used by themselves but often are used \\nas substatements of a larger statement such as an if-else  statement.\\nProgramming Tip:  Some programmers always use compound statements within other \\nstatements such as if-else , even when only a single statement appears between the braces. \\nDoing so makes it easier to add another statement to the compound statement, but more \\n importantly, it avoids the error that would occur if you forgot to add the braces. We encourage \\nyou to follow this convention, even though we do not always do so in this book to save space.\\n B.40  You can omit the else  part. If you do, nothing happens when the tested expression is false. For \\nexample, if your bank does not charge an overdraft penalty, the statement would be the following, \\ninstead of the previous one:\\nif (balance >= 0)\\n{   System.out.println(\"Good for you. You earned interest.\");   balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;} // end if\\nIf balance  is negative, the statement after the closing brace executes next.\\n Boolean Expressions\\n B.41  A boolean expression is an expression that is either true or false. The expression\\nbalance >= 0\\nthat we used in the previous if-else  statement is an example of a simple boolean expression. Such \\nexpressions compare two things, like numbers, variables, or other expressions. Figure B-3 shows \\nthe various Java comparison operators you can use to compare two expressions.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

Often, when you write an if-else  statement, you will want to use a boolean \\nexpression that is more complicated than a simple comparison. You can form more-complicated \\nboolean expressions from simpler ones by joining expressions with either the Java version of “and,” which is \\n&&, or the Java version of “or,” which is ||. For example, consider the following:\\nif ((pressure > min) && (pressure < max))\\n    System.out.println(\"Pressure is OK.\");\\nelse   \\n System.out.println(\"Warning: Pressure is out of range.\");\\nIf the value of pressure  is greater than min, and the value of pressure  is less than max, the output \\nwill be\\nPressure is OK.\\nOtherwise, the output is\\nWarning: Pressure is out of range.\\nNote that you cannot use a string of inequalities in Java, like the following:\\nmin < pressure < max  Illegal!\\nInstead, you must express each inequality separately and connect them with &&, as follows:\\n(pressure > min) && (pressure < max)\\nThe parentheses in the previous expression are not necessary, but we typically include them. The \\nparentheses that surround the entire expression in an if-else  statement are required, however.\\nThe binary operators && and || together with the unary operator ! are logical operators. We \\nlook at each of them next.\\n B.43  The operator &&. When you form a larger boolean expression by connecting two smaller expres-\\nsions with &&, the entire larger expression is true provided that both of the smaller expressions \\nare true. Thus, if at least one of pressure > min  and pressure < max  is false, the larger expres-\\nsion is false. Moreover, if the first part of the larger expression is false, the second part is ignored, since the larger expression must be false regardless of the value of the second part. For example, if \\npressure  is less than min, we know that\\n(pressure > min) && (pressure < max)\\nis false without looking at pressure < max ./H11350 Greater than or equal to /H11022/H11005 points /H11022/H11005 60\\n/H11349  Less than or equal to /H11021/H11005 expenses /H11021/H11005 income\\n/H11022 Greater than /H11022 expenses /H11022 income\\n/H11021  Less than /H11021 pressure /H11021 max\\n/H11005 Equal to  /H11005/H11005 balance /H11005/H11005 0\\n   answer /H11005/H11005 \\'y\\'\\n/HS11005 Not equal to !/H11005 income !/H11005 tax \\n   answer !/H11005 \\'y\\'Math\\nNotationName Java\\nOperatorJava ExamplesFiGUR e B-3  Java comparison operatorsThe if-else  Statement   B-21\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

You also can use || to form a larger boolean expression from smaller ones in \\nthe same way that you use &&, but with different results. The meaning is essentially the same as \\nthe English word “or.” For example, consider\\nif ((salary > expenses) || (salary + savings > expenses))\\n   System.out.println(\"Solvent\");else   System.out.println(\"Bankrupt\");\\nIf the value of salary  is greater than the value of expenses  or the value of salary + savings  is \\ngreater than the value of expenses —or both—the output will be\\nSolvent\\nOtherwise, the output will be\\nBankrupt\\nThe entire larger expression is true if either of the smaller expressions is true. Moreover, if \\nthe first part of the larger expression is true, the second part is ignored, since the larger expression \\nmust be true regardless of the value of the second part. For example, if salary  is greater than \\nexpenses , we know that\\n(salary > expenses) || (salary + savings > expenses)\\nis true without looking at salary + savings > expenses .\\nYou use parentheses in expressions containing the || operator in the same way that you use \\nthem with &&.\\nNote:  Short-circuit evaluation\\nWhen two boolean expressions are joined by either && or ||, the second expression is not evalu-\\nated if the value of the first expression implies the value of the entire expression. Such is the  \\ncase if the first expression is false when the operator is && or true when the operator is ||. This \\nbehavior is known as the short-circuit evaluation of a boolean expression.\\nBesides saving execution time, short-circuit evaluation can prevent execution errors. For \\nexample, the following statement prevents a division by zero:\\nif ((count != 0) && (sum / count > minimum))\\nIf count  is zero, the expression count != 0  is false. Thus, the expression sum / count > minimum  \\nis not evaluated, thereby avoiding the erroneous division.\\n B.45  The operator !. You can negate a boolean expression by preceding it with the operator !. For \\nexample, the expression\\n!(number >= min)\\nhas the same meaning as the expression\\nnumber < min\\nIn this case, you can and should avoid using !.\\nSometimes, however, the use of ! makes perfect sense. For example, if you have two strings \\nthat should be the same for normal processing to continue, you would compare them and issue a warning if they are not equal.

In particular, you can use one if-else  statement within another \\nif-else  statement to get nested if-else  statements, as illustrated by the following:\\nif (balance >= 0)   if (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)      balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;   else      System.out.println(\"Cannot have a negative interest.\");else   balance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;\\nIf the value of balance  is greater than or equal to zero, the entire following if-else  statement is \\nexecuted:\\nif (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)   balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;else   System.out.println(\"Cannot have a negative interest.\");\\nWhen writing nested if-else  statements, you may sometimes become confused about which \\nif goes with which else . To eliminate this confusion, you can add braces as follows:\\nif (balance >= 0){   if (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)      balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;   else      System.out.println(\"Cannot have a negative interest.\");}else   balance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;\\nHere, the braces are an aid to clarity but are not, strictly speaking, needed. In other cases, they are \\nneeded. While you should use indentation to indicate your intentions, remember that it is ignored by the compiler.The if-else  Statement   B-23\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

The following two if-else  statements differ only in \\nthat one has a pair of braces, but they do not have the same meaning:\\n// First Version\\nif (balance >= 0){   if (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)      balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;}else   balance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;\\n// Second Version\\nif (balance >= 0)   if (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)      balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;else   balance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;\\nIn the second version, without braces, the else  is paired with the second if, not the first one, as \\nthe indentation leads us to believe. Thus, the meaning is\\n// Equivalent to Second Versionif (balance >= 0){   if (INTEREST_RATE >= 0)      balance = balance + (INTEREST_RATE * balance) / 12;   else      balance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;}\\nTo clarify the difference a bit more, consider what happens when balance  is less than zero. \\nThe first version causes the following action:\\nbalance = balance - OVERDRAWN_PENALTY;\\nHowever, the second version takes no action.\\nNote:  In an if-else  statement, each else  is paired with the nearest previous unmatched if.\\nProgramming Tip:  Indentation within an if-else  statement does not affect the action of \\nthe statement. For clarity, you should use indentation that matches the logic of the statement.\\n Multiway if-else  Statements\\n B.48  Since an if-else  statement has two outcomes, and each of these two outcomes can have an \\n if-else  statement with two outcomes, you can use nested if-else  statements to produce any \\nnumber of possible effects. Convention provides a standard way of doing this. Let’s start with an \\nexample.\\nSuppose balance  is a variable that holds your checking account balance and you want to \\nknow whether your balance is positive, negative (overdrawn), or zero. To avoid any questions \\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

To find out if your balance  is positive, negative, or zero, \\nyou could use the following nested if-else  statement:\\nif (balance > 0)\\n   System.out.println(\"Positive balance\");else if (balance < 0)   System.out.println(\"Negative balance\");else if (balance == 0)   System.out.println(\"Zero balance\");\\nThis is really an ordinary nested if-else  statement, but it is indented differently than before. The \\nindentation reflects the logic more clearly and is preferred. Although this is not a separate kind of \\nif-else  statement, we call this nested construction a multiway if-else  statement.\\nWhen a multiway if-else  statement is executed, the application tests the boolean expres-\\nsions one after the other, starting from the top. When it finds the first true boolean expression, \\nit executes the statement after the expression. The rest of the if-else  statement is ignored. For \\nexample, if balance  is greater than zero, the preceding statements will display\\nPositive balance\\nExactly one of the three possible messages will be displayed, depending on the value of the vari-able \\nbalance .\\n B.49  The previous example has three possibilities, but you can have any number of possibilities by add-ing more \\nelse-if  parts. In this example, the possibilities are mutually exclusive. That is, only \\none of the three possibilities can actually occur for any given value of balance . However, you can \\nuse any boolean expressions, even if they are not mutually exclusive. If more than one boolean expression is true, only the action associated with the first true boolean expression is executed. A multiway \\nif-else  statement never performs more than one action.\\nIf none of the boolean expressions is true, nothing happens. However, it is a good practice \\nto add an else  clause—without any if—at the end, to be executed in case none of the boolean \\nexpressions is true. In fact, we can rewrite our previous example in this way. We know that if \\nbalance  is neither positive nor negative, it must be zero. So we do not need the test\\nif (balance == 0)\\nThus, we can and should write the previous if-else  statement as\\nif (balance > 0)\\n   System.out.println(\"Positive balance\");else if (balance < 0)   System.out.println(\"Negative balance\");else   System.out.println(\"Zero balance\");\\n The Conditional Operator (Optional)\\n B.50  To allow compatibility with older programming styles, Java includes an operator that is a nota -\\ntional variant on certain forms of the if-else  statement. A conditional operator expression  \\nconsists of a boolean expression followed by a question mark and two expressions separated by a \\ncolon. For example, the expression on the right side of the assignment operator in the following statement is a conditional operator expression:\\nmax = (n1 > n2) ? n1 : n2;\\nThe ? and : together form a ternary operator that has three operands and is known as the \\n conditional operator. If the boolean expression is true, the value of the first of the two  expressions \\nis returned; otherwise, the value of the second of the two expression is returned. Thus, the logic of this example is equivalent toThe if-else  Statement   B-25\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

If you decide to use them in your program, realize that not everyone will \\nknow their meaning.\\nThe switch  Statement\\n B.51  Multiway if-else  statements can become unwieldy when you must choose from among many \\npossible courses of action. If the choice is based on the value of an integer or character expression, \\nthe switch  statement can make your code easier to read.\\nThe switch  statement begins with the word switch  followed by an expression in parentheses. \\nThis expression is called the controlling expression. Its value must be of type int, char , byte , \\nshort , or String . The switch  statement in the following example determines the price of a ticket \\naccording to the location of the seat in a theater. An integer code that indicates the seat location is the controlling expression:\\nint seatLocationCode;\\n< Code here assigns a value to  seatLocationCode  >\\n. . .\\ndouble price = −0.01;switch (seatLocationCode){\\n   case 1:\\n      System.out.println(\"Balcony.\");      price = 15.00;      break;   case 2:      System.out.println(\"Mezzanine.\");      price = 30.00;      break;   case 3:      System.out.println(\"Orchestra.\");      price = 40.00;      break;   default:      System.out.println(\"Unknown ticket code.\");      break;} // end switch\\nThe switch  statement contains a list of cases, each consisting of the reserved word case , a \\nconstant, a colon, and a list of statements that are the actions for the case. The constant after the \\nword case  is called a case label. When the switch  statement executes, the controlling expres-\\nsion—in this example, seatLocationCode —is evaluated. The list of alternative cases is searched \\nuntil a case label that matches the current value of the controlling expression is found. Then the action associated with that label is executed. You are not allowed to have duplicate case labels, as that would be ambiguous.\\nIf no match is found, the case labeled \\ndefault  is executed. The default  case is optional. \\nIf there is no default  case, and no match is found to any of the cases, no action takes place. \\n Although the default  case is optional, we encourage you to always use it. If you think your cases \\ncover all the possibilities without a default  case, you can insert an error message or an assertion \\nas the default  case. You never know when you might have missed some obscure case.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

If \\nyou omit the break  statement, the action just continues with the statements in the next case until \\nit reaches either a break  statement or the end of the switch  statement. Sometimes this feature is \\ndesirable, but sometimes omitting the break  statement causes unwanted results.\\nNote:  The controlling expression in a switch  statement provides an entry point to a case \\nwithin the statement. Execution continues from this point until it reaches either a break  state-\\nment or the end of the switch .\\n B.52  At times, you will want to take the same action in more than one case. You can list cases one after \\nthe other so that they all apply to the same action. In the following example, we have changed the seat location code to a character instead of an integer. A code of B  or b , for example, indicates a \\nbalcony seat:\\nchar seatLocationCode;\\n< Code here assigns a value to seatLocationCode  >\\n. . .\\ndouble price = −0.01;switch (seatLocationCode){\\n   case \\'B\\':\\n   case \\'b\\':      System.out.println(\"Balcony.\");      price = 15.00;      break;   case \\'M\\': case \\'m\\':      System.out.println(\"Mezzanine.\");      price = 30.00;      break;   case \\'O\\': case \\'o\\':      System.out.println(\"Orchestra.\");      price = 40.00;      break;   default:      System.out.println(\"Unknown ticket code.\");      break;} // end switch\\nThe first case, B, has no break  statement; in fact, the case has no action statements at all. Execu-\\ntion continues with the case for b , as desired. Note that we have written the cases in two ways to \\nshow two common programming styles.\\nThe controlling expression in a switch  statement need not be a single variable. It can be a more \\ncomplicated expression, but it must evaluate to a single value. The expression cannot indicate a \\nrange of values. That is, the expression cannot be a boolean expression like the ones you use in an \\nif-else  statement. Thus, if you want to take one action when the controlling expression has values \\nfrom 1 to 10 and a second action for values from 11 to 20, you would need a case label for each value. In situations like this, a \\nswitch  statement would be harder to write than an if-else  statement.\\nProgramming Tip:  Omitting a break  statement\\nIf you test a program that contains a switch  statement and it executes two cases when you \\nexpect it to execute only one case, you probably have forgotten to include a break  statement \\nwhere one is needed.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

You should also take care that the possible strings assigned to \\nseatLocationCode  match the case labels exactly. In this example, the labels use lowercase letters. \\nTo ensure that the value of the controlling expression uses lowercase letters, we can replace the \\nbeginning of the switch  statement with\\nswitch (seatLocationCode.toLowercase())\\nSegment B.76 later in this appendix will describe the String  method toLowercase  further.\\nenumerations\\n B.54  To compute a student’s quality-point average—also known as a grade-point average—a pro-gram could assign the number of quality points for a given letter grade to the \\ndouble  variable \\nqualityPoints . You could use a char  variable grade  for the letter grade, but then it could contain \\nany character, not just the letters A , B, C, D, and F . Instead, to restrict the contents of grade  to \\nthe values you specify, you could declare it as an enumerated data type, or enumeration. An enumeration itemizes the values that a variable can have.\\nFor example, the following statement defines \\nLetterGrade  as an enumeration:\\nenum LetterGrade {A, B, C, D, F}\\nLetterGrade  behaves as a class type, so we can declare grade  to have this type, as follows:\\nLetterGrade grade;\\nThe items listed between the braces in the definition of LetterGrade  are objects that grade  can \\nreference. These values behave as static constants. For example, you can write\\ngrade = LetterGrade.A;\\nto assign A to grade . You qualify each of them with the name of the enumeration just as you \\nqualify the constant PI with the name of its class Math . Assigning a value other than A, B, C, D, or \\nF to grade  will cause a syntax error.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

Therefore, you cannot define an enumeration within \\na method. Instead, define enumerations outside of any method definitions, preferably near the  \\nbeginning of your class. Also, note that no semicolon follows an enumeration’s definition. \\n Writing one, however, will not cause a syntax error; the semicolon will simply be ignored.\\n B.55  Example. You can use a switch  statement with a variable whose data type is an enumeration. For \\nexample, if we define LetterGrade  and grade  as in the previous segment, the following switch  \\nstatement assigns the correct number of quality points to the double  variable qualityPoints :\\nswitch (grade)\\n{   case A:      qualityPoints = 4.0;      break;   case B:      qualityPoints = 3.0;      break;   case C:      qualityPoints = 2.0;      break;   case D:      qualityPoints = 1.0;      break;   case F:      qualityPoints = 0.0;      break;   default:      qualityPoints = -9.0;} // end switch\\nSince the data type of the expression in the switch  statement is an enumeration, the case l  abels are \\nassumed to belong to that enumeration without qualification. In fact, writing\\ncase LetterGrade.A: // Syntax error\\nfor example, is a syntax error. However, if you need to reference one of the enumerated values \\nelsewhere within the switch  statement, you must qualify it.\\nSince we know that grade  cannot have values other than those in the enumeration, a default \\ncase is unnecessary. However, if you choose to omit the default case, you must assign a value to \\nqualityPoints  prior to the switch  statement to avoid a syntax error. Without this initialization, \\nthe compiler would think it possible for qualityPoints  to remain uninitialized after the switch  \\nstatement.\\n B.56  When the compiler encounters an enumeration, it creates a class that has several methods. Among them is the method \\nordinal , which you can use to access the ordinal value of an object within an \\nenumeration. These values begin at zero. Thus, in LetterGrade , the ordinal values of A and F are \\n0 and 4, respectively. For example, if you have the following assignment:\\nLetterGrade yourGrade = LetterGrade.A;\\nthe expression\\nyourGrade.ordinal()\\nreturns 0.

For example, the expression\\nLetterGrade.valueOf(\"A\")\\nreturns LetterGrade.A . The string passed to valueOf  must match the name of the constant exactly.\\nAppendix C discusses enumerations further, beginning at Segment C.30.\\nScope\\n B.57  The scope of a variable (or a named constant) is the portion of a program in which the variable \\nis available. That is, a variable does not exist outside of its scope. A variable’s scope begins at its \\ndeclaration and ends at the closing brace of the pair of braces that enclose the variable’s declara-tion.\\nFor example, consider the following statements that involve two variables, \\ncounter  and \\n greeting :\\n{\\n   // counter and greeting are not available here   . . .   int counter = 1;   // counter is available here   . . .   {      String greeting = \"Hello!\";      // Both greeting and counter are available here      . . .   } // end scope of greeting   . . .   // Only counter is available here   . . .} // end scope of counter\\nThe variable counter  is available anywhere after its declaration. The variable greeting  is avail-\\nable only within the inner pair of braces.\\nThe concept of scope applies to every pair of braces within a Java program, regardless of \\nwhether they delineate the definition of a class or a method, appear within an if-else  statement \\nor switch  statement, or appear within the loops described in the next section.\\nLoops\\n B.58  Programs often need to repeat some action. For example, a grading program would contain some \\ncode that assigns a letter grade to a student based on the student’s scores on assignments and exams. To assign grades to the entire class, the program would repeat this action for each student in the class. A portion of a program that repeats a statement or group of statements is called a loop. \\nThe statement (or group of statements) to be repeated in a loop is called the body of the loop. Each repetition of the loop body is called an iteration of the loop.\\nWhen you design a loop, you need to decide what action the body of the loop should take and \\nwhen the loop should stop repeating this action. Once you have made these choices, you can pick one of three Java statements to implement the loop: the \\nwhile  statement, the for statement, or the \\ndo-while  statement.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 30}, page_content='Loops   B-31\\n The while  Statement\\n B.59  One way to construct a loop in Java is with a while  statement, which is also known as a while  \\nloop. A while  statement repeats its action again and again until a controlling boolean expression \\nbecomes false. That is, the loop is repeated while the controlling boolean expression is true. The \\ngeneral form of a while  statement is\\nwhile ( expression )\\n   statement ;\\nThe while  loop starts with the reserved word while  followed by a boolean expression in \\nparentheses. The loop body is a statement, typically a compound statement enclosed in braces \\n{}. The loop body is repeated while the boolean expression is true. The loop body normally \\ncontains some action that can change the value of the boolean expression from true to false and so end the loop.\\nFor example, the following \\nwhile  statement displays the integers from 1 to a given integer \\nnumber :\\nint number;\\n. . . // Assign a value to number hereint count = 1;while (count <= number){   System.out.println(count);   count++;} // end while\\nLet’s suppose that number  is 2. Since the variable count  begins at 1, the boolean expression  \\ncount <= number  is true at this point, and so the body of the loop executes. Thus, 1 is displayed and \\nthen count  becomes 2. The expression count  <= number  is still true, so the loop’s body executes a \\nsecond time, displaying 2 and incrementing count  to 3. Now count  <= number  is false, so the while  \\nloop ends. Execution continues with the statement, if any, that follows the loop.\\nNotice that if number  is zero or negative in the previous example, nothing is displayed. The \\nbody of the loop would not execute at all, since count , which is 1, would be greater than number .\\nProgramming Tip:  A while  loop can perform zero iterations\\nThe body of a while  loop can execute zero times. When a while  loop executes, its first action is \\nto check the value of the boolean expression. If the boolean expression is false, the loop body is not executed even one time. Perhaps the loop adds up the sum of all your expenses for the day. If you did not go shopping on a given day, you do not want the loop body to execute at all.\\n B.60  Infinite\\tloops. A common program bug is a loop that does not end but simply repeats its loop body \\nagain and again. A loop that iterates its body repeatedly without ever ending is called an infinite \\t\\nloop. Normally, a statement in the body of the loop will change some variables so that the control -\\nling boolean expression becomes false. If this variable does not change in the right way, you can \\nget an infinite loop.\\nFor instance, let’s consider a slight variation to the previous example of a while  loop. If we \\nforget to increment count , the boolean expression will never change and the loop will be infinite:\\nint count = 1;\\nwhile (count <= number){   System.out.println(count);} // end while\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

However, some infinite loops will run forever if left alone. To \\nend a program that is in an infinite loop, you should learn how to force a program to stop running. The way to do this depends on your particular operating system. For example, in a Unix operating system, you would press the key combination Control-C.\\nSometimes a programmer might intentionally write an infinite loop. For example, an ATM \\nmachine would typically be controlled by a program with an infinite loop that handles deposits and withdrawals indefinitely. However, at this point in your programming, an infinite loop is likely to be an error.\\n The for Statement\\n B.61  When a counter controls the number of iterations in a while  loop, you can replace the while  state-\\nment with a for statement, or for loop. The for statement has the following general form:\\nfor ( initialize; test; update)\\n   statement ;\\nHere initialize is an optional assignment of a value to a variable, test is a boolean expression, and \\nupdate is an optional assignment that can change the value of test.\\nFor example, the following for statement is exactly equivalent to the while  statement in \\n Segment B.59:\\nint count, number;\\n. . . // Assign a value to number herefor (count = 1; count <= number; count++)   System.out.println(count);\\nThe first of the three expressions in parentheses, count  = 1, initializes the counter before the \\nloop body is executed for the first time. The second expression, count  <= number , is a boolean \\nexpression that determines whether the loop should continue execution. This boolean expression \\nis tested immediately after the first expression executes and again after each execution of the third expression. The third expression, \\ncount++ , executes after each iteration of the loop body. Thus, \\nthe loop body is executed while count  <= number  is true.\\nIn the previous example, we declared count  before the for statement. After the loop  completes \\nits execution, count  is still available as a variable. We could instead declare count  within the for \\nstatement, as follows:\\nint number;\\n. . . // Assign a value to number herefor (int count = 1; count <= number; count++)   System.out.println(count);\\nIn this case, count  is defined only within the for loop and is not available after the loop completes \\nits execution.\\nProgramming Tip:  Although declaring a variable within a for statement is convenient, \\nrealize that the variable’s scope is then the for loop. The variable is not available after the loop \\ncompletes its execution.\\nThe counter in a for statement is not restricted to an integer type. It can have any primitive \\ntype. You can omit any of the expressions initialize, test, and update from a for statement, but you \\ncannot omit their semicolons. Sometimes it is more convenient to write the initialize part before \\nthe for statement or to place the update part within the body of the loop. This is especially true \\nwhen these parts are lengthy. Although you technically can omit the test from a for loop, you will \\nget an infinite loop if you do.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 32}, page_content='Loops   B-33\\nSome Java programmers tend to favor the for statement over the while  statement because \\nin the for statement the initialization, testing, and incrementing of the counter all appear at the \\nbeginning of the loop. This tendency is especially true for loops that simply count. For more \\n complex logic, a while  loop is often more appropriate.\\nNote:  A for statement is basically another notation for a kind of while  loop. Thus, like a \\nwhile  loop, a for statement might not execute its loop body at all.\\n B.62  The comma in for statements. A for loop can perform more than one initialization. To use a list \\nof initialization actions, separate the actions with commas, as in the following example:\\nint n, product;\\nfor (n = 1, product = 1; n <= 10; n++)   product = product * n;\\nThis for loop initializes n to 1 and product  to 1. Note that you use a comma, not a semicolon, to \\nseparate the initialization actions.\\nYou can have multiple update actions that are separated by commas. This can sometimes lead \\nto a situation in which the for statement has an empty body and still does something useful. For \\nexample, we can rewrite the previous for statement in the following equivalent way:\\nfor (n = 1, product = 1; n <= 10; product = product * n, n++);\\nIn effect, we have made the loop body part of the update action. Notice the semicolon at the end of \\nthe statement. Since a semicolon at the end of a for statement is often the result of a programming \\nerror, a clearer way to write this loop makes the empty body explicit:\\nfor (n = 1, product = 1; n <= 10; product = product * n, n++)\\n{} // end for\\nHowever, the most readable style uses the update action only for variables that control the loop, \\nas in the original version of this for loop.\\nFinally, you cannot have multiple boolean expressions to test for ending a for loop. However, \\nyou can string together multiple tests by using the && and || operators to form one larger boolean \\nexpression.\\nProgramming Tip:  If you have used other programming languages that have a \\n general-purpose comma operator, be warned that the comma operator in Java can appear  \\nonly in for statements.\\n B.63  Using an enumeration with a for statement. The for statement has another form when you \\nwant to repeat statements for each object in an enumeration. For example, if you define\\nenum Suit {CLUBS, DIAMONDS, HEARTS, SPADES}\\nthe for loop\\nfor (Suit nextSuit : Suit.values())   System.out.println(nextSuit);\\ndisplays\\nCLUBSDIAMONDSHEARTSSPADES\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 33}, page_content='B-34  Appendix B   Java Basics\\nYou declare a variable to the left of a colon in the for statement. To the right of the colon, \\nyou represent the values that the variable will have. For the enumeration Suit , the expression \\nSuit.values()  represents the four possible values CLUBS , DIAMONDS , HEARTS , and SPADES . As \\nthe loop executes, nextSuit  takes on each of these values.\\nThis kind of loop—called a for-each loop—can be used with other collections of data, as you \\nwill see.\\n The do-while  Statement\\n B.64  The do-while  statement, or do-while  loop, is similar to the while  statement, but the body of a \\ndo-while  statement always executes at least once. As you saw earlier, the body of a while  loop \\nmight not execute at all.\\nThe general form of a do-while  statement is\\ndo\\n   statement ;\\nwhile ( expression );\\nThe do-while  loop starts with the reserved word do. The loop body is a statement, typically a \\ncompound statement enclosed in braces {}. The loop ends with the reserved word while  followed \\nby a boolean expression in parentheses and a semicolon.\\nProgramming Tip:  Be sure to include a semicolon at the end of a do-while  statement.\\nThe loop body executes and is repeated while the boolean expression is true. The loop body \\nnormally contains some action that can change the value of the boolean expression from true to \\nfalse and so end the loop. The boolean expression is tested at the end of the loop, not at its begin -\\nning, as it is in a while  statement. Thus, the loop body executes at least once even if the boolean \\nexpression starts out false.\\nThe following do-while  statement displays the integers from 1 to a given integer number :\\nint number;\\n. . . // Assign a value to number hereint count = 1;do{   System.out.println(count);   count++;} while (count <= number);\\nAgain, let’s suppose that number  is 2. The variable count  begins at 1 and is displayed. Next, \\ncount  is incremented to 2. Since the expression count  <= number  is true at this point, the body \\nof the loop executes again. The value of count  (2) is displayed, and then count  becomes 3. The \\nexpression count  <= number  is now false, so the do-while  loop ends. Execution continues with the \\nstatement that follows the loop.\\nIf number  is zero or negative in the previous example, 1 is displayed, since the body of the \\nloop executes at least once. If number  can possibly be zero or negative, we should use either a \\nwhile  loop or a for loop here instead of a do-while  loop.\\nNotice that we placed the ending brace and the while  on the same line. Some programmers \\nprefer to place them on different lines. Either form is fine, but be consistent.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 34}, page_content='Loops   B-35\\nTo better understand a do-while  loop, let’s rewrite the previous example in the following way:\\nint number;\\n. . . // Assign a value to number hereint count = 1;{   System.out.println(count);   count++;}while (count <= number){   System.out.println(count);   count++;}\\nWhen you compare the two versions, it is obvious that a do-while  loop differs from a while  loop \\nin only one detail. With a do-while  loop, the loop body is always executed at least once. With a \\nwhile  loop, the loop body might not execute at all.\\n Additional Loop Information\\n B.65  Choosing a loop statement. Suppose you decide that your program needs a loop. How do you \\ndecide whether to use a while  statement, a for statement, or a do-while  statement? You cannot use \\na  do-while  statement unless you are certain that the loop body should execute at least one time. If \\nyou are certain of this, a do-while  statement is likely to be a good choice. However, more often than \\nyou might think, a loop requires the possibility that the body will not execute at all. In those cases, you must use either a \\nwhile  statement or a for statement. If it is a computation that changes some \\nnumeric quantity by some equal amount on each iteration, consider a for statement. If the for state-\\nment does not work well, use a while  statement. The while  statement is always a safe choice, since \\nyou can use it for any sort of loop. But sometimes one of the other alternatives is easier or clearer.\\nProgramming Tip:  A while  loop can do anything that another loop can do.\\n B.66  The break  and continue  statements in loops. You can use the break  statement in a switch  state-\\nment or in any kind of loop statement. When the break  statement executes in a loop, the immediately \\nenclosing loop ends, and the remainder of the loop body is not executed. Execution continues with the statement after the loop.\\nAdding a \\nbreak  statement to a loop can make the loop more difficult to understand. Without \\na break  statement, a loop has a simple, easy-to-understand structure. There is a test for ending \\nthe loop at the top (or bottom) of the loop, and every iteration will go to the end of the loop body. When you add a \\nbreak  statement, the loop might end because either the condition given at the top \\n(or bottom) of the loop is false or the break  statement has executed. Some loop iterations may go \\nto the end of the loop body, but one loop iteration might end prematurely. Because of the compli-cations they introduce, you should avoid \\nbreak  statements in loops. Some authorities contend that \\na break  statement should never be used to end a loop, but virtually all programming authorities \\nagree that they should be used at most sparingly.\\nThe continue  statement ends the current iteration of a loop. The loop continues with the \\nnext iteration. Using a continue  statement in this way has the same problems as using a break  \\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

However, replacing an empty loop body with a continue  statement is acceptable. For \\nexample, you can revise the loop at the end of Segment B.62, as follows:\\nfor (n = 1, product = 1; n <= 10; product = product * n, n++)\\n   continue;\\nProgramming Tip:  In general, do not use break  or continue  statements within the body \\nof a loop.\\nThe Class String\\n B.67  Strings of characters, such as \"Enter the amount:\" , do not have a primitive type in Java. How-\\never, Java does provide a class, called String , that you use to create and process strings of char -\\nacters. The string constant \"Enter the amount:\" , in fact, is a value of type String . The class \\nString  is part of the package java.lang  in the Java Class Library.\\nA variable of type String  can name one of these string values. The statement\\nString greeting;\\ndeclares greeting  to be the name of a String  variable, and the following statement sets the value \\nof greeting  to the String  value \"Hello!\" :\\ngreeting = \"Hello!\";\\nThese two statements are often combined into one, as follows:\\nString greeting = \"Hello!\";\\nWe now can display greeting  on the screen by writing\\nSystem.out.println(greeting);\\nThe screen will show\\nHello!\\n Characters Within Strings\\n B.68  Most programming languages use the ASCII character set, which assigns a standard number to \\neach of the characters normally used on an English-language keyboard. Java, however, uses the Unicode character set instead. The Unicode character set includes all the ASCII characters plus many of the characters used in languages that have an alphabet different from English. As it turns out, this is not likely to be a big issue if you are using an English-language keyboard. Normally, you can just program as if Java were using the ASCII character set, since the codes for the ASCII characters are the same in Unicode. The advantage of the Unicode character set is that it allows you to easily handle languages other than English. The disadvantage of the Unicode character set is that it requires two bytes to store each character, whereas the ASCII character set requires one.\\n B.69  Escape characters. Suppose we want to display the following line on the screen:\\nThe word “Java” names a language and a drink!\\nThis string contains quotes, so the statement\\nSystem.out.println(\"The word \"Java\" names a language and a drink!\");\\nwill not work: It produces a compiler error message. The problem is that the compiler sees\\n\"The word \"\\nas a perfectly valid quoted string. Then the compiler sees\\nJava\"\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 36}, page_content='The Class String   B-37\\nwhich is not valid in the Java language. The compiler does not know that we mean to include the \\nquote character as part of the string unless we tell it that we want to do so. We tell the compiler this by placing a backslash \\n\\\\ before the troublesome character, like so:\\nSystem.out.println(\"The word \\\\\"Java\\\\\" names a language and a drink!\");\\nSome other special characters also need a backslash in order to be included in strings. They \\nare listed in Figure B-4. These are often called escape characters because they escape from the usual meaning of a character in Java, such as the usual meaning of the double-quote character.\\nFiGUR e B-4 Escape characters\\n\\\\\" Double quote.\\n\\\\\\' Single quote (apostrophe).\\\\\\\\ Backslash.\\\\n New line . (Go to the beginning of the next line.)\\n\\\\r Carriage return. (Go to the beginning of the current line.)\\\\t Tab. (Insert whitespace up to the next tab stop.)\\nIt is important to note that each escape sequence is a single character, even though it is spelled \\nwith two symbols. So the string \"Say \\\\\"Hi\\\\\"!\"  contains 9 characters, not 11.\\nTo include a backslash in a string, you must write two backslashes. Displaying the string \\n\"abc\\\\\\\\def\"  on the screen would produce\\nabc\\\\def\\nWriting the string with only one backslash, as in \"abc\\\\def\" , is likely to produce the error \\nmessage “Invalid escape character,” because \\\\d is invalid.\\nThe escape sequence \\\\n indicates that the string starts a new line at the \\\\n. For example, the \\nstatement\\nSystem.out.println(\"The motto is\\\\nGo for it!\");\\nwill write the following to the screen\\nThe motto is\\nGo for it!\\nYou can include a single quote (apostrophe) inside a quoted string, such as \"How\\'s this?\" , \\nbut you cannot write a single quote within single quotes. Thus, to define a single-quote character, \\nyou use the escape sequence \\\\\\', as follows:\\nchar singleQuote = \\'\\\\\\'\\';\\n Concatenation of Strings\\n B.70  You can join two strings by using the + operator. Joining two strings together, end to end, to obtain \\na larger string is called concatenation. When + is used with strings, it is sometimes called the \\nconcatenation operator. For example, the statements\\nString greeting = \"Hello\";\\nString sentence = greeting + \"my friend.\";System.out.println(sentence);\\nset the variable sentence  to \"Hellomy friend.\"  and will write the following on the screen:\\nHellomy friend.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 37}, page_content='B-38  Appendix B   Java Basics\\nNo space separates the first two words, because no spaces are added when you concatenate two \\nstrings. If we want sentence  to contain \"Hello my friend.\" , we could change the assignment \\nstatement to\\nsentence = greeting + \" my friend.\";\\nNotice the space before the word “my.”\\nYou can concatenate any number of String  objects by using the + operator. You can even \\nconcatenate a String  object to any other type of object and get a String  object as a result. Java \\ncan express any object as a string when you concatenate it to a string. For primitives like numbers, Java does the obvious thing. For example,\\nString solution = \"The answer is \" + 42;\\nwill set the String  variable solution  to \"The answer is 42\" . This is so natural that it may \\nseem as though nothing special is happening, but it does require a real conversion from one type to another. The Java literal \\n42 is an integer, whereas \"42\"  is a string consisting of the two \\ncharacters 4 and 2. Java converts the integer constant 42 to the string constant \"42\"  and then \\nconcatenates the two strings \"The answer is \"  and \"42\"  to obtain the longer string \\n\"The  answer is 42\" .\\nNote:  Every class has a method toString  that Java uses to get a string representation of any \\nobject. If you do not define toString  for a class that you write, the default toString  will return \\na representation of an object’s location in memory. Thus, you generally should provide your \\nown toString  method when you define a class. Appendixes C and D discuss this method in \\nmore detail.\\nYou can also concatenate a single character to a string by using +. For example,\\nString label = \"mile\";String pluralLabel = label + \\'s\\';\\nsets pluralLabel  to the string \"miles\" .\\nSegment B.73 will show you another way to concatenate strings.\\n String  Methods\\nReaders who need to review Java methods should consult Appendix C before reading this section.\\n B.71  A String  object has methods as well as a value. You use these methods to manipulate string values. \\nA few of these String  methods are described here. You invoke, or call, a method for a String  object \\nby writing the object name, a dot, and the name of the method, followed by a pair of parentheses. \\nSome methods require nothing within the parentheses, while others require that you specify argu-ments. Let’s look at some examples.\\n B.72  The method length . The method length  gets the number of characters in a string. For example, \\nsuppose we declare two String  variables as follows:\\nString command = \"Sit Fido!\";  // 9 characters\\nString answer = \"bow-wow\";     // 7 characters\\nNow command.length()  has the value 9 (it returns 9), and answer.length()  returns 7. Notice \\nthat you must include a pair of parentheses, even though there are no arguments to the method \\nlength . Also notice that spaces, special symbols, and repeated characters are all counted in \\ncomputing the length of a string. All characters except the double quotes that enclose the string \\nare counted.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 38}, page_content='The Class String   B-39\\nYou can use a call to the method length  anywhere that you can use a value of type int. For \\nexample, all of the following are legal Java statements:\\nint count = command.length();\\nSystem.out.println(\"Length is \" + command.length());count = answer.length() + 3;\\n B.73  The method concat . You can use the method concat  instead of the + operator to concatenate two \\nstrings. For example, if we declare the String  variables\\nString one = \"sail\";String two = \"boat\";\\nthe expressions\\none + two\\nand\\none.concat(two);\\nare the same string, sailboat.\\n B.74  Indices. Some of the methods in the class String  refer to the positions of the characters in the \\nstring. Positions in a string start with 0, not with 1. Thus, in the string \"Hi Mom\" , H is in position \\n0, i is in position 1, the blank character is in position 2, and so forth. A position is usually referred \\nto as an index. So it would be more normal to say that H  is at index 0, i  is at index 1, and so on. \\nFigure B-5 illustrates how index positions are numbered in a string.\\nFiGUR e B-5 Indices 0 through 11 for the string \"Java is fun.\"\\n01 23 45 67 89 10 11\\nJ a v a i s f u n .\\n B.75  The methods charAt  and indexOf . The method charAt  returns the character at the index given \\nas its one argument. For example, the statements\\nString phrase = \"Time flies like an arrow.\";char sixthCharacter = phrase.charAt(5);\\nassign the character f  to the variable sixthCharacter , since the f  in flies is at index 5. (Remember, \\nthe first index is 0, not 1.)\\nThe method indexOf  tests whether a string contains a given substring and, if it does, returns \\nthe index at which the substring begins. Thus, phrase.indexOf(\"flies\")  will return 5 because \\nthe substring flies begins at index 5 within phrase .\\nNote:  Out-of-bounds index\\nString  methods such as charAt  that take an index as an argument will cause an error during \\n execution if the index is negative or too large. Such an index is said to be out of bounds. The \\n error causes a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException . Java Interludes 2 and 4 discuss exceptions.\\n B.76  Changing case. The method toLowerCase  returns a string obtained from its argument string by \\nreplacing any uppercase letters with their lowercase counterparts. Thus, if greeting  is defined by\\nString greeting = \"Hi Mary!\";\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 39}, page_content='B-40  Appendix B   Java Basics\\nthe expression\\ngreeting.toLowerCase()\\nreturns the string \"hi mary!\" . An analogous method, toUpperCase , converts any lowercase letters \\nin a string to uppercase. Note the capital C  in toLowerCase  and toUpperCase .\\n B.77  The method trim . The method trim  trims off any leading and trailing white space, such as blanks. \\nSo the statements\\nString command = \"   Sit Fido!    \";\\nString trimmedCommand = command.trim();\\nset trimmedCommand  to the string \"Sit Fido!\" . The blanks between words are not affected.\\n B.78  Comparing strings. You use the method compareTo  to compare two strings. Strings are ordered \\naccording to the Unicode values of their characters. This ordering—called lexicographic ordering—is \\nanalogous to alphabetic ordering. The expression\\nstringOne.compareTo(stringTwo)\\nreturns a negative integer or a positive integer, depending on whether stringOne  occurs before or \\nafter stringTwo . The expression returns zero if the two strings are equal.\\nThe method compareToIgnoreCase  behaves similarly to compareTo , except that the uppercase and \\nlowercase versions of the same letter are considered to be equal. For example, the method compareTo  \\nplaces the string \"Hello\"  before the string \"hello\" , but the method compareToIgnoreCase  finds these \\nstrings to be equal.\\nProgramming Tip:  Do not use the operators ==, !=, <, <=, >, or >= to compare the contents \\nof two strings.\\nIf you want only to see whether two strings are equal—that is, contain the same values—you \\ncan use the method equals . Thus,\\nstringOne.equals(stringTwo)\\nis true if stringOne  equals stringTwo  and is false if they are not equal. The method equals- \\nIgnoreCase  behaves similarly to equals , except that the uppercase and lowercase versions \\nof the same letter are equal. For example, the method equals  finds the strings \"Hello\"  and \\n\"hello\"  unequal, but the method equalsIgnoreCase  finds them equal.\\nProgramming Tip:  When applied to two strings (or to any two objects), the operator == \\ntests whether they are stored in the same memory location. Sometimes that is sufficient, but if  \\nyou want to know whether two strings that are in different memory locations contain the same \\nsequence of characters, use the method equals .\\nThe Class StringBuilder\\n B.79  Once you create a string object of the class String , you cannot alter it. But sometimes you would \\nlike to. For example, we might define the string\\nString name = \"rover\";\\nand then decide that we want to capitalize its first letter. We cannot. We could, of course, write\\nname = \"Rover\";\\nbut this statement creates a new string Rover and discards rover.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

You can pass an indexed variable as an argument to a method anyplace that you \\ncan pass an ordinary variable of the array’s entry type. For example, if a method has the header\\npublic double compute(double value)\\nand temperature  is the array of double  values that we defined earlier, we can invoke the method \\nby writing\\ndouble result = compute(temperature[3])\\nAn entire array can also be a single argument to a method. For example, the following method\\npublic static void incrementArrayBy2(double[] array)\\n{   for (int index = 0; index < array.length; index++)      array[index] = array[index] + 2;} // end incrementArrayBy2\\nwill accept any array of double  values as its single argument. We declare the parameter array  in \\nthe method’s header just as we would declare any other array: by specifying the type of the array \\nentries followed by square brackets. We do not specify the length of the array.\\nThe following statement is an example of how we would invoke this method:\\nincrementArrayBy2(temperature);\\nYou use no square brackets when you pass an entire array as an argument to a method. Notice that the method can take any length array as an argument. The method \\nincrementArrayBy2  adds 2 to \\neach entry in the argument array temperature . That is, the method actually changes the values in \\nthe argument array.\\nNote:  A method can change the values in an argument array. However, a method cannot  \\nreplace an argument array with another array.\\n B.88  Arrays as return values. In Java, a method can return an array. For example, rather than modi-fying its array argument, the previous method \\nincrementArrayBy2  could return an array whose \\nvalues are 2 more than the corresponding values in the array argument. You specify the method’s return type in the same way that you specify a type for an array parameter. The method would then look like this:\\npublic static double[] incrementArrayBy2(double[] array)\\n{   double[] result = new double[array.length];   for (int index = 0; index < array.length; index++)      result[index] = array[index] + 2;   return result;} // end incrementArrayBy2\\nThe following statements invoke this method:\\ndouble[] originalArray = new double[10];\\n< Statements that place values into originalArray  >\\n. . .\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

For example, to \\ninvoke the method in the previous example, you do not write\\ndouble[] revisedArray = new double[10]; // WRONG!revisedArray = incrementArrayBy2(originalArray);\\nThe first statement allocates 10 locations for a new array, but these locations are discarded when the second statement executes.\\n Initializing Arrays\\n B.89  You can provide initial values for the elements in an array when you declare it. To do this, you \\nenclose the values for the array in braces and place them after the assignment operator, as in the following example:\\ndouble[] reading = {3.3, 15.8, 9.7};\\nYou do not explicitly state the array’s length. Instead the length is the minimum number of loca-tions that will hold the given values. This initializing declaration is equivalent to the following statements:\\ndouble[] reading = new double[3];\\nreading[0] = 3.3;reading[1] = 15.8;reading[2] = 9.7;\\nIf you do not initialize the elements of an array, they are given initial default values according \\nto their type. For example, if you do not initialize an array of integers, each element of the array \\nwill be initialized to zero. In an array of objects, each element is initialized to null . However, it \\nis usually clearer to do your own explicit initialization, either when you declare the array or later by using a loop and assignment statements.\\n Array Index Out of Bounds\\n B.90  When programming with arrays, making a mistake with an index is easy. This is especially true if that index is an expression. If the array \\ntemperature  has seven elements, but an index \\nis some  integer other than 0 through 6, the index is said to be out of bounds. An out-of-bounds \\nindex expression will compile without any error message, but will cause an error when you run your program. In particular, you will get an \\nIndexOutOfBoundsException . As we mentioned in \\n Segment  B.75, a similar situation can occur when you work with strings. (Java Interludes 2 and 4 \\ndiscuss exceptions.)\\n Use of = and == with Arrays\\n B.91  The operator =. Recall that a variable for an object really contains the memory address of the \\nobject. The same is true of arrays. All array locations are together in one section of memory so that one memory address can specify the location of the entire array. The assignment operator copies this memory address. For example, if \\na and b are arrays of the same size, the assignment \\nb = a gives the array variable b the same memory address as the array variable a. In other words, \\na and b are two different names for the same array. These variables are aliases. Thus, when you \\nchange the value of a[2] , you are also changing the value of b[2] . Appendix C talks more about \\naliases and references.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 47}, page_content='B-48  Appendix B   Java Basics\\nIf you want the array b to have the same values as the array a, but in separate memory loca-\\ntions, then instead of one assignment statement you must use a loop like the following one:\\nfor (int index = 0; index < a.length; index++)\\n   b[index] = a[index];\\n B.92  The operator  ==. The equality operator == tests two arrays to see if they are stored in the same \\nplace in the computer’s memory. It does not test whether the arrays contain the same values. To \\ndo so, you must compare the two arrays entry by entry. For example, if the arrays a and b contain \\nprimitive values and have the same length, the following code could be used:\\nboolean match = true;\\nint index = 0;while (match && (index < a.length)){   if (a[index] != b[index])      match = false;   else      index++;} // end while\\nif (match)\\n   System.out.println(\"Arrays have the same contents\");else   System.out.println(\"Arrays have different contents\");\\nIf the arrays contained objects instead of primitive values, we would use the boolean expression \\n!a[index].equals(b[index])  instead of a[index] != b[index] .\\nNote:  Are arrays really objects?\\nArrays behave very much like objects. On the other hand, arrays do not belong to any class. \\n Because arrays were used by programmers for many years before classes and objects (as we have used them) were invented, arrays use a special notation of their own. Other features of \\n objects do not apply to arrays, such as inheritance (which we discuss in Appendix D). So \\n whether or not arrays should be considered objects is primarily an academic debate. Whenever Java documentation says that something applies to all objects, it also applies to arrays.\\nNote:  Array types are reference types\\nA variable of an array type holds only the address where the array is stored in memory. This memory address is often called a reference to the array object in memory. For this reason, an \\n array type is a reference type. A reference type is any type whose variables hold references—that is, memory addresses—as opposed to the actual item named by the variable. Array types and class types are both reference types. Primitive types are not reference types.\\n Arrays and the For-Each Loop\\n B.93  Earlier in Segment B.63 we used a for-each loop to process all the values in an enumeration. We \\ncan use a similar for-each loop to process all the values in an array. For example, the following statements compute the sum of the integers in an array:\\nint[] anArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\\nint sum = 0;\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

For example, suppose we wanted to store the \\ndollar amounts shown in Figure B-8 in some sort of array. The bold items are just labeling. There are 60 entries. If we use an array with one index, the array will have a length of 60, and keeping track of which entry goes with which index would be almost impossible. On the other hand, if we allow ourselves two indices, we can use one index for the row and one index for the column. This arrangement is illustrated in Figure B-9.\\nFiGUR e B-8 A table of values\\nThe effect of various interest rates on $1000 when \\ncompounded annually (rounded to whole dollars )\\nYear 5.00% 5.50% 6.00% 6.50% 7.00% 7.50%\\n1 $105 0 $105 5 $106 0 $106 5 $107 0 $107 5\\n2 $110 3 $111 3 $112 4 $113 4 $114 5 $115 6\\n3 $115 8 $117 4 $119 1 $120 8 $122 5 $124 2\\n4 $121 6 $123 9 $126 2 $128 6 $131 1 $133 5\\n5 $127 6 $130 7 $133 8 $137 0 $140 3 $143 6\\n6 $134 0 $137 9 $141 9 $145 9 $150 1 $154 3\\n7 $140 7 $145 5 $150 4 $155 4 $160 6 $165 9\\n8 $147 7 $153 5 $159 4 $165 5 $171 8 $178 3\\n9 $155 1 $161 9 $168 9 $176 3 $183 8 $191 7\\n10 $162 9 $170 8 $179 1 $187 7 $196 7 $206 1\\nNote that, as was true for the simple arrays you have already seen, you begin numbering \\nindices with 0 rather than 1. If the array is named table  and it has two indices, the Java notation \\ntable[3][2]  specifies the entry in the fourth row and third column. By convention, we think of \\nthe first index as denoting the row and the second as denoting the column. Arrays that have exactly two indices can be displayed on paper as a two-dimensional table and are called two-dimensional arrays. More generally, an array is said to be an n -dimensional array if it has n  indices. Thus, the \\nordinary one-index arrays that we have used up to now are one-dimensional arrays.\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

To declare and create \\nthe array table  with 10 rows and 6 columns, we write\\nint[][] table = new int[10][6];\\nYou can have arrays with any number of indices. To get more indices, you just use more square brackets in the declaration.\\nIndexed variables for multidimensional arrays are just like indexed variables for one-dimen-\\nsional arrays, except that they have multiple indices, each enclosed in a pair of square brackets. For example, the following statements set all the elements in \\ntable  to zero:\\nfor (int row = 0; row < 10; row++)\\n   for (int column = 0; column < 6; column++)      table[row][column] = 0;\\nNote that we used two for loops, one nested within the other. This is a common way of stepping \\nthrough the indexed variables in a two-dimensional array. If we had three indices, we would use \\nthree nested for loops, and so forth for higher numbers of indices.\\nAs was true of the indexed variables for one-dimensional arrays, indexed variables for multi-\\ndimensional arrays are variables of the array’s entry type and can be used anywhere that a variable of the entry type is allowed. For example, for the two-dimensional array \\ntable , an indexed vari-\\nable such as table[3][2]  is a variable of type int and can be used anyplace that an ordinary int \\nvariable can be used.\\nA multidimensional array can be a parameter of a method. For example, the following method \\nheader has a two-dimensional array as a parameter:\\npublic static void clearArray(double[][] array)\\n B.96  Java implements multidimensional arrays as one-dimensional arrays. For example, consider the array\\nint[][] table = new int[10][6];\\nThe array table  is in fact a one-dimensional array of length 10, and its entry type is int[] . Thus, \\neach entry in the array table  is a one-dimensional array of length 6. In other words, a multidimen-\\nsional array is an array of arrays.\\nNormally, you do not need to be concerned with this fact, since this detail is handled auto-\\nmatically by the compiler. However, sometimes you can profit from this knowledge. For example, consider the previous nested \\nfor loops that filled the two-dimensional array table  with zeros. We \\nused the constants 6 and 10 to control the for loops, but it would be better style to use the data \\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.

To do so, we need to think in terms of an array of arrays. For example, the \\nfollowing is a rewrite of the nested for loops:\\nfor (int row = 0; row < table.length; row++)\\n   for (int column = 0; column < table[row].length; column++)      table[row][column] = 0;\\nHere, table.length  is the number of rows in table , and table[row].length  is the number of columns.\\nWrapper Classes\\n B.97  Java makes a distinction between the primitive types, such as int, double , and char , and the class \\ntypes, such as String  and the classes that you write. Java sometimes treats primitive types and class \\ntypes differently. For example, an argument to a method and the assignment operator = behave dif-\\nferently for primitive types and class types. To make things uniform, Java provides a wrapper class \\nfor each of the primitive types that enables us to convert a value of a primitive type to an object of a corresponding class type.\\nFor example, the wrapper class for the primitive type \\nint is the predefined class Integer . If \\nwe want to convert an int value, such as 10, to an object of type Integer , we can do so in one of \\nthree ways, as the following statements demonstrate:\\nInteger ten = new Integer(10);\\nInteger fiftyTwo = new Integer(\"52\");Integer eighty = 80;\\nIn the first way, you supply an int value as a literal, a variable, or an expression. In the second, \\nyou provide a string that contains an int value. The third way allows you to simply assign an int \\nvalue without using the new operator.\\n B.98  Once you have defined Integer  objects, you can compare them by using the methods compareTo  \\nand equals , much as you compare strings or the other objects we have discussed in this appendix. \\nDo not use operators such as ==. Just as for strings and other objects, operators like == compare \\nthe memory addresses of objects, not their values.\\nIf you need the value of an Integer  object as a primitive, you can use methods such as intValue  \\nor doubleValue . For example, if ten is defined as in the previous segment, the expression\\nten.intValue()\\nreturns the int value 10, whereas\\nten.doubleValue()\\nreturns the double  value 10.0. You also can simply assign the Integer  object to an int variable, as in\\nint primitive10 = ten;\\nNo type cast is necessary; however, using one is not an error.\\n B.99  Boxing and unboxing. When performing arithmetic with Integer  objects, for example, you can \\nuse the same operators that you use for arithmetic with primitives. You can also intermix primitive \\nintegers with Integer  objects. Thus, you can write statements such as the following:\\nScanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);\\nSystem.out.print(\"What is his age? \");int hisAge = keyboard.nextInt();System.out.print(\"What is her age? \");Integer herAge = keyboard.nextInt();\\nInteger ageDifference = Math.abs(hisAge - herAge);\\nSystem.out.println(\"He is \" + hisAge + \", she is \" + herAge +                   \": a difference of \" + ageDifference + \".\");\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ. All Rights Reserved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'example/te_tbook_supplement_appendi__export/Textbook_AppB_(java basics).pdf', 'page': 51}, page_content='B-52  Appendix B   Java Basics\\nJava converts between int and Integer  as necessary. The process of converting from a primitive \\ntype to a corresponding wrapper class is called boxing. Unboxing is the process used to convert in \\nthe other direction. Since these conversions happen automatically, they are often called auto-boxing \\nand auto-unboxing. Realize that the previous statements are just a demonstration of what is pos-\\nsible. Using only primitive integers for this simple computation is certainly adequate.\\n B.100  The wrapper classes for the primitive types double , float , long , and char  are Double , Float , \\nLong , and Character , respectively. You create objects of these classes in a way analogous to how \\nyou create Integer  objects. Except for Character , each wrapper class has methods that return a \\nvalue in a variety of types. Integer  has the methods doubleValue , floatValue , intValue , and \\nlongValue . Double , Float , and Long  also have these same methods. The class Character  has only \\nthe analogous method charValue .\\nMany of the classes that we study in this book represent collections of objects. If your data \\nhas a primitive type, an appropriate wrapper class enables you to represent the data as objects so that you can use these classes.\\n B.101  Wrapper classes also contain some useful static constants. For example, you can find the largest and smallest values of any of the primitive number types by using the associated wrapper class. The largest and smallest values of type \\nint are\\nInteger.MAX_VALUE and Integer.MIN_VALUE\\nThe largest and smallest values of type double  are\\nDouble.MAX_VALUE and Double.MIN_VALUE\\n B.102  Wrapper classes have static methods that can be used to convert a string to the corresponding number of type \\nint, double , long , or float . For example, suppose your program needs to convert \\nthe string \"199.98\"  to a double  value (which will turn out to be 199.98, of course). The static \\nmethod parseDouble  of the wrapper class Double  will convert a string to a value of type double . \\nSo if theString  is a variable of type String  whose value is \"199.98\" ,\\nDouble.parseDouble(theString)\\nreturns the double  value 199.98. The other wrapper classes Integer , Long , and Float  have the \\nanalogous methods parseInt , parseLong , and parseFloat .\\nIf there is any possibility that the string named by theString  has extra leading or trailing \\nblanks, you should instead use\\nDouble.parseDouble(theString.trim())\\nAs we discussed in Segment B.77, the method trim , included in the class String , trims off \\nleading or trailing white space, such as blanks. If the string is not a correctly formed number, the invocation of \\nDouble.parseDouble  will cause an exception. The use of trim  helps some in \\navoiding this problem.\\n B.103  Each of the numeric wrapper classes also has a static method called toString  that will convert in \\nthe other direction—that is, it will convert from a primitive numeric value to a string representa-tion of the numeric value. For example,\\nInteger.toString(42)\\nreturns the string value \"42\" , and\\nDouble.toString(199.98)\\nreturns the string value \"199.98\" . Additionally, each wrapper class, like all other classes, has a \\nnonstatic version of toString . For example, if we define n as follows:\\nInteger n = new Integer(198);\\nthen n.toString()  returns the string \"198\" .\\n© 2015 Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ.
